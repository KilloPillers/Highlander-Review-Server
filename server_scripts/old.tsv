AHS008	1.00	if you just do the essays and participate a little in class you can get an easy A. Professor Brookshire is super nice and accommodating. 	1	12/17/2020
AHS010S	4.00	Nicole Strathman is a very chill professor. Class is not that difficult if you go to class and take notes. No homework, gave out extra credit which was to go to a museum and answer the questions, she gives out pop quizzes which are short answer(about 3-4 questions), midterm was short answer questions and a page front and back of multiple choice (midterm is easy only if you study) gotta rememeber the images she shows, final is online and she posts questions all you gotta do is answer each question using key terms and at least a page each. legit all her quizzes and tests are all on the lecture so just show up to class. sounds like a lot but its really not. good luck. 	4	6/5/2020
AHS017B	4.00	gave 4 quizzes instead of two midterms so it made it easier to memorize the information, final project, and a final exam. Puts powerpoints of the lecture on ilearn and the points for discussion sections are just attendance	4	3/20/2020
AHS021	3.00	Took Spring 2021 (online) w/ Katherine Rush. Pretty easy course, just take notes and participate every once in a while. Lectures are recorded and discussions are mandatory. There's readings but you mainly need to read short articles for discussion and skim through lecture readings b/c the assignments require it. ~6 writing assignments throughout the quarter and 1 final paper (make sure to be really specific when explaining). Pretty easy class and its interesting. Prof is also really nice and understanding	3	5/30/2021
AHS023	5.00	Professor Weems is great. The exams aren't particularly easy, but not that bad. 	5	8/3/2021
AHS028	6.33	LeBlanc is a good prof and entertaining, gives 2 midterms and one final and an essay and make sure you do well on those if you want a good grade. Her exams are heavily memorization based so get ready to memorize 10+ images per week with the dates, medium, artist, culture, etc. Overall the class is difficult but not impossible if you put in work.	6	2/7/2020
		Taking this class online is difficult because Professor Le Blanc spends about half an hour talking about the Dodgers or politics before finally settling into the lecture. She also rambles a bit so you have to really pay attention or ask specific questions. The material isn't really difficult to understand, it's just that whatever she says in lecture is so niche that you have to be present. Our midterm was assigned over three days, and it was THREE five page essays regarding images on slides that gave no further information than who painted it in what year. And on top of that two weeks later we have another five page essay due that isn't even a final.	7	11/16/2020
		Had it with LeBlanc. The class is based off slides and extra readings that can be from 10-20 pages long. Discussions are based off the readings but you can sometimes just skim through the reading and you'll be fine. You need to sign up on a website to get your participation grade which is only 3 lectures but you don't actually have to participate. Lecture isn't mandatory only the 3 days you sign up. There are 1-2 paragraph unit responses which weren't even that bad and are due every 2 or 3 weeks I believe. 1 midterm, 1 paper and a final. Midterm consists of 3 questions 5 pages in length and she only gives you about a week to complete. Final is the same format. If you don't like writing, then I wouldn't recommend this class. 	6	3/8/2021
AHS165	1.00	Summer 2022. Online. No discussion. Took with Molly Bond. Simple class with easy quizzes based off asynchronous material in class. Attendance matters. The final is an essay regarding various pieces of art. Super easy homework assignments. Make sure to read the readings.  	1	7/11/2022
AHS182	3.00	Spring 23, in person with prof. Kotz. Not a good prof for this class. I did not learn much and she is extremely scatterbrained. She has never gotten back to many of our emails and her guidelines for assignments are very vague. She has not even graded anything and by the time I am writing this it is week 9. She does not know how to use canvas. I would not suggest this professor at all. This class should have been online. 	3	5/29/2023
ANTH001	2.75	Prof. Sally Ness: 1 MT 1 Final Non-cumulative. Minimal reading (only to keep up in discussion). At minimum: take notes in lecture, attend and participate in discussion. 	2	4/5/2017
		"I took the class with Prof. McMullin. She assigned 3 essays, with 1F and 1M. There is assigned readings but not really any hw besides readings and essays, I only remember having to write like a paragraph and turn it in online. She links back readings and videos we watch in class to lectures, expects a mention or 2 in your essays, and many questions on the midterm and final are based on them. In short, doing the readings, they're pretty important. Her TAs can be strict or lenient, pray on that, as they grade your 3 essays. McMullin is very much lenient herself, she gave us an extra credit opportunity for 30 free points on our 200 point midterm and even gave us the final's essay questions as take home. 

TLDR: Easy class, IF you do the readings. DO READINGS. "	2	12/11/2018
		"Class is not difficult, but the way your TA grades makes a huge difference. You need to go to lectures and all discussions, counts for like 10%. Pray that your TA is lenient, because the essay rubrics are very subjective (10 points can be docked off resulting in a B- just for ""lack of persuasiveness"".) Do the readings, the exams are based on them and lecture. Overall, the material is not difficult, but the grading is sooo subjective, even for the exams."	5	1/5/2019
		Homework, Professor was boring, exams were lame. 	7	3/27/2019
		I had Prof. McMullin. A LOT of reading.	3	4/3/2019
		Took it with Dr. Nida; Go to lecture for clickers, read occasionally, and go to discussion and you should be fine, passed with an A+	2	6/8/2019
		Had worku nida, its an easy class but a lot of homework. Dont sit at the front of the class if youre shy	2	6/15/2019
		Easy with Professor Nida. 1 midterm (50 multiple choice) and 1 cumulative final (100 questions). 4 one page movie reviews, 2 two page papers, and attendance is taken through poll everywhere. Many extra credit points available. 	1	6/15/2019
		took it with Dr. Nida this quarter, honestly he is a good professor. just do the readings because some concepts are not intuitive. 3 assignments in the entire quarter and clicker questions that are answered on a free app during lecture. 	2	11/26/2019
		A lot of homework and reading, just go to class for poll everywhere questions. Midterm had 60 multiple choice questions with 3 extra credit multiple choice questions. (63 total) He gave 15 extra poll everywhere points to everyone so there is possibility for extra credit. 	5	12/6/2019
		Worku Nida has a thick accent but you get used to it. He uses poll everywhere so attending lecture is kinda mandatory. We had two 2 page papers to write which you got an A on if you put any effort into them. It was a very interesting class and I would recommend. 	5	12/10/2019
		Dr. Nida - I wouldn't say this class was free. You definitely need to read to do well on the midterms and finals since the questions are based off of the readings. However, everything else was easy and if you are diligent in not missing points by not attending lecture, answering clickers, doing the extra credit, you can easily get over a 100% in the class. The extra credit literally boosts your grade by 4%. His RMP rating is deceivingly bad but I would still recommend taking this class.	4	12/14/2019
		Dr Nida is a wonderful and sweet man, and obviously knows the content he's teaching, but unfortunately he can't lecture to save his life. I believe he teaches during fall and spring quarters. Attendance is done through PollEverywhere so show up to lecture for that. Otherwise if you do the readings, show up to discussion (my TA was wonderful - Breidy if you're reading this you're the best!), and do what's required you'll be okay. 3 assignments, 1 midterm, and 1 final which is only cumulative for everything covered after the midterm. There is also 10 points of extra credit. I finished with a B+ in the class and I think I could have done better if my participation grade were higher. 	3	12/14/2019
		Just read the text book and all of the tests are multiple choice.	3	2/18/2020
		I got an A+ without studying that much-review the study guide and go to class, participate in discussion	1	3/26/2020
		Took it online with Prof Worku Nida. He does prerecorded lectures. His class consists of 2 essays (one is 2 pages long and another is 3 pages), 1 midterm and 1 final (which he gives out optional practice exams before each), and discussion is mandatory. Pretty easy A. 	3	7/1/2020
		Had Nida, he is the best ever for this class! I loved him, easy A if u put in the work.	2	8/10/2020
		Easy Class. Every exam questions are on quizlet. Please always submit your work on-time and attend to all lectures if possible.	3	3/16/2021
		"dr nida winter 2021: super interesting subject, lectures optional. never really had to study past the weekly homework ""quizzes"", and grading of writing assignments all depends on your ta--i got really lucky w reed who was super nice and lenient."	3	3/20/2021
		Had this with Professor Nida. This isn't a difficult class at all and was my first Breadth class I took at UCR. As long as you study before the exams, you should be good.	3	5/22/2021
		Took with Dr. Nida W22. Very easy class. However, you have to pay a lot for the ebook, and some assignments. Never went to lecture, still got an A. 2 easy essays about covid and your culture. Did not like the Public Anthropology essay. Had to pay $15 just to turn in an essay and have it peer reviewed. That could have easily been assigned in canvas. 	1	3/9/2022
		Winter 2022, I had Nidua? Never attended lectures only discussion, easy A. Great breadth class. 	3	3/19/2022
		"Took it in Winter '22 with Prof. Worku Nida and it was a pretty easy class. I never went to lecture and just did the assignments, and got an A. My only issue with the class is that you have to pay for EVERYTHING. You are required to pay for the textbook, quizzes, journal, and our ""project,"" which was literally just to write a short letter and do some peer reviews. All of these things could have easily been done on Canvas, but instead we had to pay $50+ for it all. In short, the class is an easy A if you are willing/able to pay for all the materials."	2	3/31/2022
		This class is extremely disorganized and lectures are hard to understand, but the material is common sense for the most part. Prompts are terribly long when they don't need to be. 	3	5/27/2022
		Took it with Professor Nida. Easy class that mostly consists of busy work. However, if you're up for the challenge, you could probably complete most of the busy work within the first week. Exams are replaced by papers you have to write, and you're given plenty of time to complete. Honestly, the most important part for this course is the discussion section. Since Nida basically doesn't talk to students, any questions you may have should be asked to the TA. Discussion sections are also mandatory, making them just that important. Overall, fairly easy A.	3	6/5/2022
		Took it with Dr. James during Fall'22 and course was based on discussion assignment and 2 papers which were manageable!  	1	1/6/2023
		Easiest class I have taken in my life, I got an A+ and didn't even attend lecture, the essays were super easy. Attendance only counts towards discussion and that is it, overall one of the easiest class I have ever taken in my life. Also you can do the homework or inquisitive quizzes in about a week, I mean all of it. Just go to TA office hours for clarifying questions.	1	4/3/2023
ANTH002	3.92	Took this class with Professor Greer.  Really nice guy and funny at times.  Final exam is easy.  Study his powerpoints (he posts them on iLearn) and you won't even need to read the book.	1	3/20/2017
		Pretty easy class for the most part with Greer, but for Midterm 2 and the Final, there were a lot of primate species to memorize, and check the notes on the bottom of his lecture slides.	4	12/10/2017
		Took with Dr. Greer, you have to memorize his slides.	7	12/13/2017
		Took it with prof becker, 2 midterms + cumulative final but it was mostly multiple choice, got a c on final and ended with an a in the class, reading helps a lot with understanding material and answering pop quizzes (easy points), discussion wasn’t that helpful but i had a bad ta so 	7	3/29/2018
		Read the book and go to lecture and you'll be fine. Took it with Sara Becker	5	12/18/2018
		it is pretty difficult and tests were not curved for me	7	6/4/2019
		Pretty easy if you go to lecture and do all the homework. Dr. Becker is a pretty good professor and she knows her stuff. 	4	12/10/2019
		Took this class online with Dr. Berger and found it to be very easy. No midterms or finals. Only required assignments are weekly quizzes based off the textbook, as well as a short essay (4 pages) at the end of the quarter. She offers a lot of extra credit and additional optional assignments (extra essays, a podcast, infographic, etc.) meant to help raise your grade. Would definitely recommend.	2	12/11/2020
		Took this with Berger, and I loved it! You get out of the class what you put in...literally. You choose your assignments worth diff points to build your grade with only one essay being mandatory to pass (beyond discussion work and attendance). 	3	12/30/2020
		Taken Fall 2020 with Dr. Berger, like others mentioned you get out what you put into the class. There's no formal midterm or final and with the bare minimum effort of showing up to class, discussions, doing the weekly open book/note lecture quizzes, and one 900-1200 word essay you'd get a 75%. Doing additional assignments (another essay, an infographic, an around 10 minute podcast/YouTube video, or a research poster) would raise your grade by 10 or 15 percent each. 	2	6/6/2021
		Had Maureen Hickey (Winter 2023), and as long as you put in the bare minimum effort for the class (attending lectures and doing the homework) you should do well. Attendance for lectures are required and recorded through a PollEverywhere, and homework consists of 15-18 multiple choice questions per chapter. Homework is based on mastery, so you can easily get 100% for each assignment. First half of content is really basic bio, but the second half picks up with more specific taxonomy and primate classification. During discussions right before the midterms/final, the TAs will give you topics and practice questions that pop up on the tests verbatim. She's really nice and enthusiastic about bio anth! super sweet prof	3	4/6/2023
ANTH003	4.20	Professor Schwartz. Imo, not too terribly of a hard class if you keep up with the readings. I did not keep up with the readings. The class is split into the lecture portion, and the discussion portion. In discussion, you will research an archaeological site (Giza, Technotitlan, etc...) and give an oral presentation, write a group paper on the site, and an individual paper about one certain aspect of the site (indigineous people, religion, tourism etc). This is worth ~50% of your grade. The other half is the lecture portion. I personally did not care at all for the material presented. It was all dates and sites of importance cause they found evidence of fire here or whatever. Very uninteresting stuff. One midterm, one final. The average the midterm was a C, i believe. Shows how much everyone didn't understand what was going on. The average on the final i believe wasn't much better. I ended up with a C- in the clAss, which I'm honestly ok with. Difficult class, imo. Take cultural anthropology. I've heard its easy. Definitely easier that world pre history lol	9	6/28/2017
		"Prof. Thomas Fenn:
Memory-heavy, bi-weekly short writing assignments
The professor doesn't communicate with the class much, so be ready for a pretty independent experience. Studying for the midterm and exams can be done in less than two days.
A little tedious, but definitely not hard. Imagine your typical AP History high school class but with less work and heavier exams."	3	9/22/2018
		I took it with a professor named Jennifer Sylversten (I totally butchered her last name now). She was really chill and made the class easy. 	3	11/22/2018
		Take this with Karl Taube. Easy class, one midterm, one final, each worth 40% of grade. Discussion section attendance worth the other 20%. He hands out an outline of the lecture at the beginning of class. Read the textbook and go to lecture.	2	3/17/2020
		Took with Karl Taube. He's a nice cool professor but his lectures make you fall asleep. 	4	6/21/2020
ANTH005	4.27	Took it with Professor Stanton and his grading policy is very straightforward. He doesn't post slides online, so if you don't attend lecture regularly, you'll most likely fail the class. Easy to follow the class but it could get really boring sometimes. Going to discussion and following the study guide helps a lot for the exams	4	1/4/2018
		Ok teacher, not hard and not easy. Memorization is key	6	3/29/2019
		The midterm and final require lots of memorizing, however, a fairly accurate study guide is given. The writing assignments and quizzes are super easy and should be an easy grade booster.	4	1/11/2020
		Took this course online w/ Stanton because of quarantine. I did not watch all of the pre-recorded lectures because I relied more on the textbook (which he wrote himself). The online reading quizzes were easy and directly pulled out of the textbook. The five assignments in section are really easy. Two midterms and one final, all multiple choice. 	3	6/3/2020
		I had Professor Tsukamoto as my professor, and I had a lot of fun in class. I'm not really interested in archaeology, so I was a little hesitant taking the course, but I'm happy I did it. I will be honest though, he is incredibly difficult to understand due to his thick accent, but if you read the book he provides you, the class is incredibly easy. The quizzes are very straightforward and short, the exams are exactly what he describes them to be. My TA Johanna Najera was also super nice and she is very knowledgable on the topics that we learn. She also worked with the professor on various excavations that he went to. Overall a pretty easy and engaging class, just make sure you show up to every lecture because he asks mini quiz questions throughout every lecture. 	5	11/16/2020
		Two midterms and a final and online chapters quizzes, overall, interesting class and if you take notes it will be easy.	2	11/20/2020
		So fun I loved this class with Tsukamoto and you just have to keep up on the vocab and put in a bit of effort into the exercises and you’ll be good 	3	12/22/2020
		Took it with Professor Stanton. Very awesome professor. Very understanding. It was asynchronous and heavy on memorization. The lectures were a little boring sometimes but overall a good class. 	4	12/28/2020
		"This class is pretty lecture heavy BUT there's no exams, only writing assignments / ""projects"" and so it's a pretty easy class if writing is your thing. Professor Santasilia is kinda strict at times and lectures are mandatory but it's a great class"	4	2/2/2021
		(Spring 2021 Online) Professor Stanton. Maybe it's because the course was online but it was really simple. He had pre-recorded lectures but also held lectures that were optional. I never went and I did well on my quizzes/exams just by using the resources given by him. The class itself was graded by a few assignments given during discussion, easy chapter quizzes, 2 midterms, and the final. Discussion attendance is a must. (Be prepared to pay for the website/book he uses). Again, this course was online for me so it might be different when courses are back on campus.	2	6/3/2021
		"DO NOT TAKE IF THE PROFESSOR IS NAWA SUGIYAMA. She's sweet but she goes through the ppt slides way too fast for anyone to take notes, and the ""study guides"" for the midterm and the final are literally just pages and pages of terms to memorize. And when most of the class bombed the midterm (the class average was a D-), she didn't curve it. You also *have* to buy the $80 book or you literally won't be able to complete any of the quizzes that were assigned for homework since they're on a separate website connected to the book. The midterm/final was a bunch of mc questions, pick 3 short answer questions, and one long essay question. She always uploads the slides and everything is in the textbook anyway so there's really no point in going to class."	10	2/28/2023
ANTH006	See MUS006			
ANTH007S	2.00	Easy A. Took it with Stephan James. Completely asynchronous (10-30 minute podcasts). A couple of 3-4 sentence short assignments, a presentaion (3 minutes long, it is meant to be commercial of sorts for your final project) and a final project on a language of your choice(your given multiple options on how to do it: essay, powerpoint, art peice, presentation, podcast). Discussion section was just going over key points, show up and you get participation points.	2	3/25/2021
		Took it Winter '22 with Prof. Hyejin Nah. Professor is super nice and accommodating! She accepted late work from students all quarter without docking points and even dropped the last assignment to give us more time with our finals. Also, lecture and discussion attendance is mandatory.	2	3/31/2022
ANTH020	6.00	I took it with Isabelle Placentia. She's pretty nice but not the best lecturer. She has a lot of requirements and specifics for assignments but doesn't really get into them. She believes there should be a discussion section for the class but there isn't, so she makes you do a lot of discussion type stuff to make up for it. One take home midterm and the final is a research project with a group. Attendance mandatory. 	6	11/18/2019
ANTH020S	2.50	Took it iwth Isabelle Placentia. Very sweet woman and easy grader. You are graded by attendence, attendence at discussion, a midterm, and a research project (includes: Proposal, Outline, Annotated Bibliography, and the 5 page paper). All the readings are posted on ilearn. 	3	3/25/2021
		Took with Professor Isabelle Placentia Fall 2021. The class was asynchronous bc the university overbooked her quarter and she had another class to teach during our scheduled time. Professor herself is super nice and understanding; she makes a real effort to help her students succeed. We met synchronously online for our discussion sessions. The class is graded on very few things; discussion attendance, a midterm, and a final paper. Discussion is really chill -- you just talk with your TA about the lecture. Midterm was MC, free response, and an essay question. A big chunk of our points came from that but it's super doable. There is a LOT of reading, but you don't need to read everything to do well. The paper covered health and healing techniques used by certain groups of people (ex: Shamanism). It was a group paper; each person wrote about 500 words to make a 2,000 word paper. Very easy class and interesting class. HOWEVER, this does not count for anthropology credit; it will count as an elective course. So if you want to knock out your sociology/psychology/anthropology breadth requirement, this course will not do that. 	2	11/6/2022
ANTH100	4.00	Took Professor Young Oh. 10 weekly response posts (500+ word response) and 2 response posts (100+ word response). A debate  video (group work optional; 10-30 minute video of you taking on the role of an anthropologists and debating a chosen topic). You have the choice of taking a comprehensive Final exam (multiple choice, True-false, and essay questions) or writing up a thesis (15 page summary-argumentation essay on the class). You can easily get by without the readings or videos, just familarize yourself with lecture slides. Hardest part of the class is if you try to keep up with all of the readings and videos, there are at least 10 each week. 	4	5/21/2021
ANTH104	4.00	Took Sara Becker. There are two major projects in the class, each being a month long. The first gives the option between a cemetery anaysis (going to a cemetery and writing a analytical report on it), and a monument burial analysis (you are given a fake monument burial scenario and have to analyze that). They are meant to be 5-6 pages long and you have the option of either doing it alone or as a group of up to 5 people. The second project is a oseobiography (choosing some bones and using knowledge learned in class to try and write a biography of the individual based on their remains; this being a 3-5 minute recording of you talking over a powerpoing and a written commentary - a couple pages). There are weekly discussions, lowest grade dropped. The midterm is about 40 questions long( multiple choice or matching letter to picture; all material from the lecture). You are allowed 1 page of notes, only one side. Final is in the same format but with a few more questions.	4	2/12/2022
ANTH115R	6.50	2 midterms, one take home quiz, and one final, good teacher, but you need to study HARD! Memorization is key to passing	8	3/23/2019
		Avoid Karl Taube. The class set up seems really simple but is stressful. You are only graded on a midterm and final. But his lecturing style makes note taking difficult. He does lectures in a story telling way and jumps back and forth between locations and time periods. The transition between topics is also very fluid and unclear. There is an extra credit paper you can do that will bring up your grade by a whole letter grade (a professor approved topic, 8-10 pages, with at least 3 sources). The midterm and final are 14 questions long (12 questions are identifying the who, what, and where of a site, defining a term, andor describing a prominent person; the last 2 are picking 2 essay questions from 3 given topics.). If taking him be sure to put major focus on memorizing names, dates, and major events tied to the sites he mentions. 	5	2/12/2022
ANTH118	7.00	Took it with Dr. Nawa Sugiyama. She works at a very fast pace and squishes in so much information into one session. Take pictures of the slides instead of taking notes so you can pay attention to what she is saying. There are weekely quizzes (only need to do 9 of 10), she uses PollEverywhere in class for participation, and there is group project on an ancient city of your choice (includes: the presentation, choosing an article for the class to read, making poll/quiz questions, and making a blog). 	7	3/25/2021
ANTH120	2.00	Online Summer course with Francisco Ramos. Very laid back professor. He grades mostly on effort of your assessments. There were 4 assignments, each being 1 - 2.5 pages (MLA format). For the online course we only had to attend class once a week. You could honestly get away with not readings or modules. Not sure how much will change once we go back to in person classes but he practically hands out A's. Textbook is given for free by professor along with any other reading materials. 	2	8/23/2021
ANTH132	9.00	Took it with Young Oh. LOTS OF WORK, AVOID THIS PROFESSOR. You are given 3 options: take weekly quizzes(10 total), 1-2 theses at the end of the quarter(7-12 pages), or a final exam(multiple choice, TF, Short answer, and essay questions) . There are weekly readings, weekly recorded lectures, 3 reflection posts(300-400 words) + feedback(100-200 words), 2 reading posts(400-800 words) +feedback(100-200 words), a book club meeting(30-90 minutes recorded and sent to professor), a meeting with the professor to discuss the topic for your eco-ethnography project, a climate change critique post(600-1000 words) + feedback(100-200 words), and an Eco-Ethnography project (includes: proposal, feedback, and the paper(2000-4000 words)). 	9	3/25/2021
ANTH140G	2.00	no final, just write random stuff on your homeworks and you pretty much guarantee at least a B in that class	2	8/24/2018
ANTH115S	9.00	Avoid taking with Karl Taube	9	12/10/2019
ANTH123	2.00	Took it with Professor Hyejin Nah. Just show up to class and turn it the assignments and it's an easy A. If you're doing a BCOE major this is a good one for DEPTH requirement if you happen to have a LING020 credit like I did.	2	4/1/2023
ANTH127S	2.00	Took Phuoc Duong. Weekly Responses (5 -10 sentences; 10 total). 1 syllabus quiz. 1 midterm (multiple choice; 52 questions). 1 Final (multiple choice). 1 final essay(6-8 pages)(For our class he took it out and added essay questions into the final due to time constraints.)Graded for attendance to lecture. Graded for attendance to discussion section. Lectures are a bit useless since he reads straight from the slide show, but he grades for attendance. before the midterm you can get away with not doing the readings since there are only 2-3 questions about the readings in the midterm, but after the midterm he starts to heavily rely on the readings in the weekly responses. Not a whole lot of work, just tedious. 	2	5/21/2021
ANTH153	5.00	Took it with Maureen Hickey. Its not a hard class itself but it was made more difficult because the lectures are so dry. She also loves break out rooms and will often leave you in those rooms for 30-40 minutes, way longer than needed. There are two midterms (30 multiple choice + one essay),a final (45 multiple choice + 5 writing prompts (1-6 sentences)), a term paper (4-6 pages), and a 30-60 second presentation on that papers findings. Be sure to make a group google doc so you can all add information for the midterm s and final, its really what got me through the class, cause it is impossible to pay attention.	5	3/25/2021
ANTH155	6.00	Elizabeth Berger is pretty great. The course is generally hard due to you having to memorize the human skeleton but she makes it a bit easier by breaking it down. She does a quiz every Friday to test your knowledge. There are no midterms or final, just 10 of the Friday quizzes. There are also in class labs that you work on every class. Not too complicated or long and she is more than willing to go through it step by step if you ask. There is no set due date for any of the labs - just get them in when you finish. Slides for lecture at posted on elearn and the book is available on Amazon. She’s a pretty nice teacher and is no too harsh of a grader. No sure if it will continue but this quarter they are testing out giving students full skeletons to take home to study with - personally never took it out of the box. 	6	11/22/2021
ANTH165G	3.00	Took Professory Anthony Jerry. There is a quarter long group project. There are 4 individual parts to turn in; question section, data section, methodology section and final report; all of it worth 175 points and takes place instead of a final. discussion posts (18 total; 2paragraphs minimum) with 2 responses (1 paragraph minimum). No midterm. He posts summaries of each readings instead of having lecture, you can read these instead of the readings, much shorter and to the point if you are short for time. He really takes his time grading, so don't expect to see anything graded till the end of the quarter. 	3	5/21/2021
ARC005	1.00	ONLINE FALL 2022, EASY MONEY, quizzes every week but you can just do all of them at the start cause theyre all on quizlet, midterm and exams are easy too	1	11/16/2022
ARC072	2.00	This class is easy, just show up, take notes, and listen. They require you to do homework but you should go for the online stuff instead of purchasing the book because it is useless and you never use it again.	4	4/16/2020
ART001	3.00	"I took it with Anna Betbeze, but generally this type of art class is very subjective and no one is ever told ""your drawing sucks."" I got an A in the class, but you shouldn't struggle to get an A whether you're an Art major like me or not. When you register, it shows the class and studio time. It's one after the other, so you're there for nearly 3 hours. Don't get discouraged by the time, it's necessary to have a long class for art because of the activities you're doing and sometimes there will be critiques - where everyone goes around to talk about what they liked about the drawing and what could be improved/done differently. Attendance is mandatory, if you miss one class you can miss out on a lot if it was on a critique day. Your homework is 3 large drawings each week, and she gives you a theme for the drawings, it's all still life for the most part. This class does require you to buy art supplies."	3	2/27/2019
ART002	2.50	(COVID ERA) I took this class with Gerald Sheffield and it was extremely easy. Art is a subjective course so you can pretty much do whatever you want in this class (as long as it pertains to the theme). Every week there's a new theme (figure, landscape, still life, etc.) and you just need to paint things based on that theme. The materials can get really pricey but Gerald was pretty lenient with whatever material you use. The online class was set up with you logging on and following Gerald's painting examples but there were also times where you explain your painting process and thoughts when you showcase and review your pieces in class. If you want an easy course without minding spending somewhere between $50-$100+ on materials then go for this class. 	1	6/10/2021
		Online summer course with Pearl Hsiung and Rosie Galanis. Easy enough class. The hardest part is dedicating enough time to paint the assignments. There are a 3 smaller assignments focusing on color and scales, 3 medium paintings and 1 final large painting. If you take the class be sure to shop around as soon as you get the requirement list so you can get the best price. The kit she recommends to get for the class starts at about $120. Don't be afraid to get cheap materials. The art department also has free art supplies they give out, so be sure to check with them too.	4	8/23/2021
ART003	1.00	took online with professor conaway, assignments were pretty simple and class time was mostly her showing photographers' work as examples or us presenting the photos we took for an assignment. labs are by appointment so you don't need to go unless you need help with smth. she was really nice & class was fun and straightforward!	1	12/9/2020
		OMG EASIEST CLASS EVER WITH SARAH first day of class mandatory, it's soo easy mondays are when she shares the images you took in class and wednesdays she would show slideshow of pics SUPER EASY CLASS i would barley even attend class and i got a A little photography assignments like taking 5 portrait pics for one week SUPER EASY RECOMMEND 100%	1	12/17/2021
ART005	4.00	Super easy with Professor Charles Long. There is reading tho.	3	3/19/2018
		Took Young Joon Kwak. Only difficult due to the professor having poor management skills. I took them in the fall quarter so thanksgiving got in the way of the final project. We only have 1 in class day to work on the final project and have to take it home to finish over break. The class over all is relatively chill. Since it’s an art class the art is subjective. Professor just needs to see that you have put in effort. There are 3 reading - 2 require write ups- and each project requires a project statement. Also different from the name you are not working with clay or ceramics. The class is about building sculptures with wood,metal,plaster, etc. It’s definitely a messy class, have clothes you don’t mind getting dirty. 	5	11/22/2021
ART006	1.00	took online with professor larios, you can probably get away with not doing anything for this class but you'll understand the material more if you actually attend class. lectures were pretty heavily discussion-based so it was mostly us talking about the readings/videos but you don't have to talk at all if you're not comfortable. in short, the class was easy and the material is very thought-provoking but can be hard to digest sometimes.	1	12/9/2020
		Great class. Mostly analysis of videos and the class is genuinely fun. Find a way to take it while the sun is up though cause walking back to the dorms from the Art Building is kind of scary.	1	1/18/2023
ART010	1.00			
AST023	See CPLT023			
AST046	See CHN046			
BCH010	1.50	The professor is really chill. If u get 85 or above, you get an A	1	11/19/2021
		I took this class with professor Paul Larsen and honestly one of the easiest classes I’ve taken. Everything is online, open note, open internet. There’s only two projects and overall he literally just wants you to listen and learn. Discussion is optional. Lecture I reccommend going to not because the material is hard but just he is a really funny guy and the stuff you learn is actually really helpful if you wanna learn about how to eat healthier .	2	5/16/2023
BCH015	2.67	Wet lab fairly simple but fitting everything in flowchart is a little tedious. Computer lab is easy but the quizzes kind of suck. Only need basic chem knowledge.	1	3/30/2019
		Molecular graphics portion was super easy, wet lab was a little harder with more math, but overall everything was easy. Molecular graphics test was a project and the wet lab final was open note and take home. Easily the easiest A I’ve ever had.	3	12/19/2020
		(Took it during Winter 2021 when classes were online) The class was relatively ok. The first half taught by Dr. Dingwall was more structured and I think easier to follow along with because it is similar to other underdiv wet lab courses. The second half that was taught by Dr. Fan was a lot more difficult for me mainly because it was unlike any other class I had taken before. You had to use this other online software to analyze molecules and you basically just followed along as Dr. Fan would show you what to do. Homework was assigned weekly and that wasn't too bad as long as you paid attention during lecture. Overall, the class isn't difficult; it's just tedious and requires a lot of time. 	4	3/25/2021
BCH095	1.00	Basically a freshman seminar for students who are majoring in Biochemistry (Pass/No Pass). Super easy class and you need to seriously try if you want to fail. Professor Debus makes it really easy for you to get points (4 question quizzes that you have unlimited attempts to finish by a deadline and Poll.ev aka. think of a clicker but online). All of the lectures are useful for you as a student because it introduces you to different resources that will help you find your path and support you during your time at UCR. Although I had enough points to pass the class, I still went to lectures for that reason. 	1	12/14/2018
		Took it with Richard Luben. At the first class, he said he would take attendance using Poll Everywhere but he never did, so majority of the class never went. Pass/No Pass class that's super easy as long as you complete the online quizzes about each presentation posted online. Even though the overall class was boring, some of the presentations taught me about more opportunities to get involved in UCR and the community to help me build up my resume as a freshman. 	1	5/8/2020
BCH096	1.00	Very useless class. Mandatory for Biochem majors with medical emphasis. One paper on plan for medical school. Class was a rehash of BCH 95 but just with the paper. 	1	6/15/2019
BCH100	5.64	Dingwall is the best prof for this course. Cutoffs are awesome. But dont fall behind in her coursework. 	6	12/31/2017
		The only reason i didn't give this a 10/10 for difficulty was the pass rate was 95%	7	3/26/2019
		Taken with Paul Larsen. Honestly was much easier than expected. Test are fair, he tells you what will be on it. There is a lot to memorize but if you keep with it it should not be a problem. Larsen is also really funny and makes class enjoyable, would recommend recording his lectures!	6	12/17/2019
		I really liked P. Larsen. He was really funny which made it easy to pay attention in class. He had 5 quizzes taken during discussion so we didn't always have to go to discussion every week. We had only one midterm and the final. He recorded lectures which was really nice because he tends to talk fast. Just make sure to be on top of your stuff and you'll do well.	5	12/4/2020
		Medium difficulty; take it with Paul Larsen. He teaches well, gives extra credit, and curves the class as well at the end. 	6	12/29/2020
		Dingwall was amazing and fair. Focus on her lectures to do well on the exam. Grade is determined by 8 homework assignments. Grade is determined by 1 midterm and 1 final	5	12/31/2020
		Took it with Dingwall and Eulgem online during Spring 2021. Tbh one of my favorite classes at UCR so far. The profs are extremely passionate and very helpful if you go to office hours. The material is a bit difficult to keep up with at first, but it is very manageable. To study for midterms, I would write out notes based off of the learning objectives. Then I would make Anki cards using my notes and the exact wording that was used on the learning objectives. Try to start memorizing pathways 2-3 days before the exams (at least). 	6	6/15/2021
		Dr. Dingwall is amazing! Everything you need to know is on her lectures, so really study them and understand it inside out. Midterm and finals are similar to quizzes and homework. Very nice professor and tries to make subject as easy as possible. 	5	12/13/2021
		take with Larsen, great teacher, cares about students and super hard to fail class (you would have to really try to fail) he gives you so many redemption points	3	12/28/2021
		Dr. Dingwall is the best! As long as you study how she tells you to, this class is an easy A. 	5	1/27/2022
		"Spring 2023, all in person. Exams are all free response. Points system (total 400 points). 150 (2 midterms), 80 (9 weekly homework, drops the lowest), 70 (weekly quizzes, drops lowest), 100 points (final exam) 

Professor Dingwall is amazing. Great lecture and teaching style. Taught this class like it was a story and used real life examples in every lecture. There was a logical and reasonable order to the topics we were learning. Lectures were very enjoyable and entertaining. She uploads lecture slides a week in advance, but I didn't need to look at them beforehand or studying anything before. I just showed up to class and did all the studying after. The exams were fair. Exam viewing and not giving back tests was a new concept to me. I understand the premise, but it did make studying for future exams different and more difficult as I wasn't able to go back and see how she likes to structure her exams. But, I don't disagree or believe it drastically affected my grades and how I study/learn. The lecture slides are very helpful as well as her summary outlines. I especially like the templates she provided and how she drew them in class with us. The most important study tool I utilized in this class was rewatching the lectures through Yuja. I did not do this for every single lecture, only the ones where we were filling in our templates. It was vital for me to be able to go back and look back at the videos as she does not post a completed version of her notes. Her office hours were helpful as well. She was very approachable and encouraging towards me as a student. Content was very dense for this class, but it was as expected. I like how we had homework every week as it kept me on top of my studies as well as the weekly quizzes. It helps cushion my grade in the class so it is not only the midterms and finals that compose of my final grade. Thank you Dr. Dingwall."	8	6/9/2023
BCH100A	8.00	So many reactions, so little time.  Dingwall is a wonderful professor with terrific cutoffs (average is about a B-, I think), but the material is difficult, so give yourself lots of time to study and prepare for each exam.	8	6/21/2018
BCH110A	8.25	Biochemistry is a very difficult subject going into if you don’t put in the work for the class. Took this class with Dr. O’Leary and Dr. Blaha and both were really great professors. Dr. O’Leary kept the lecture a little more upbeat than Dr. Blaha but both of them truly want their students to succeed. Averages are mid to high 60s but the deviations for grades are huge. An A is definitely attainable and having them record their lectures and post them up on iLearn was really useful when wanting to study for exams. 	8	12/14/2019
		Avoid Blaha, he's very boring lol	8	12/28/2020
		The material itself was not bad, it was actually interesting. The only problem was that there is so much material you have to know but only a few would show up in the exam. Exams were difficult, some were straight from the power point, but some were also from the power point but written differently. Understand the material and you'll be good.	8	1/3/2022
BCH110B	5.50	Had it with Dr.Dingwall, she is an amazing professor but don't fall behind on the lecture notes/material	7	3/31/2017
		Lots of work, but Dingwall makes the class a great experience. Her and the TAs are very open to helping you, so don't hesitate to go to their office hours for help. If you put in the effort you'll definitely get that A	4	5/18/2020
BCH110C	6.50	The instructor is super dry but the class is early in the morning which lets you get it over with early and all of the slides are there with the information to memorize and they have outline questions to help. Get the big concepts down and you'll be fine.	3	6/17/2019
BIEN001	1.00	The class consists of pure lectures and talks from research professors and faculty from different branches of the bioengineering department. Really cool stuff, only homework is a one page summary of each talk. No final, only presentation of senior design projects.	1	6/8/2019
BIEN010	1.50	Easy A. Just make something that works & present it (if it doesn't, do a proof of concept/analyze why it doesn't work).	1	5/17/2018
		Took it with Dr. Grover. Really cool class that finally lets you learn more about actual bioengineering and creating projects relating to bio instruments and we got to learn how to code with arduino, and we also learned Matlab programming and COMSOL Multiphysics. Really cool class. One easy midterm and final presentation group project.	2	6/8/2019
BIEN101	6.00	"Dr. Mckee typically teaches this. It was super dense but interesting. Exam avgs were super low and he gave us terrible 1 minute pop quizzes that everyone tanked. The ""projects"" were dumb and the hw assignments were massive"	6	4/5/2023
BIEN105	9.33	Took with Dr. Rodgers. You have a COMSOL big group project, two very tough exams (averages were never above 50/100, last exam average was 37/100) and HW that is very long but if you push through they help you understand concepts. 	9	3/20/2021
		wow <3 this class is genuinely dreadful. One of the most universally loathed courses among bioengineers. Study hard, take excellent notes, and prioritize the quarter-long group project (it was worth ~45% of the total grade for my year). The first two exams had a 25% and 40% average, and the final avg was 12% (TWELVE.)	9	4/5/2023
		Taken with Rodgers Winter 2022 (ONLINE), and easily the worst weeder class one must encounter in their career as a Bioengineering major. Heavy on DE concepts, and there are 3 midterms that make up the majority of the grade, along with a project with randomly assigned groups that require you to present at the end of the quarter about COMSOL simulations. The midterm averages were never above 50%, but if there is someone retaking the course as a 5th year, the curve would be completely shot. The concepts are extremely difficult to answer, and Rodgers likes in-class participation, so be prepared to be called on when you are in lecture, and if you want to ask a question, Rodgers will answer your questions with even more questions.	10	4/10/2023
BIEN110	5.00	Interesting material and doable assessments. Dr. Park is always a good professor -- you can tell he genuinely enjoys teaching and cares about his students.	5	4/5/2023
BIEN120	10.00	Worst class I've ever taken. Dr. Christopoulos' has a thick greek accent and speaks at a mile a minute so it was frankly impossible to keep up while writing notes. The material is pure abstract math with a linear algebra lean. Exams were awful with avgs in the ~50-60 range. There's a final and a final project involving a group term paper.	10	4/5/2023
BIEN125	3.00	Took with Dr. McKee. Nice professor, he is a little disorganized but the class is just mostly pretty easy. Weekly quizzes instead of tests, a project due at end of the quarter. Class covers some Biochem/Bio and focuses on genetic cloning.	3	3/20/2021
		Taken with Liao Winter 2022 in-person. Class is very heavy on lab-time and lab-times are long, since protein purification requires a lot of waiting/watching/idle time. Most of the grade is composed of the lab reports you write, which would be easy if you go to lab discussions and TA's office hours and just badger them with questions (they just give you answers at some point and teach you how to solve for a lot of the calculations).	3	4/10/2023
BIEN130	3.50	I took this class with Dr. Freedman. It's basically EE001/005 part 2. Review your circuit theory and don't procrastinate on the lab reports.	5	4/5/2023
		Taken with Freedman Spring 2022 (ONLINE). The lab portion of this class was very intensive, as in you will be assigned to a random lab partner and if your partner does not pull their weight, you will be stuck in lab for all 3 hours. The reports were relatively long, but not harshly graded, and the majority of the exam questions (multiple choice and free response) were on Canvas and the concepts were in the exam study guides/slide presentations.	2	4/10/2023
BIEN135	2.00	Took with Palermo, grade was made up of 2 exams and a project. All the exam questions were from the textbook, the answers to which were gone over by the TA in disucssion. Averages on exam were 95+%. Project took ~4 hours to complete	2	12/7/2021
		I took this class when Dr. Palermo was teaching. She's super sweet and accomodating but very scattered and Very Italian. When I took it the course breakdown was 50% MT 50% Final. Total breeze.	2	4/5/2023
BIEN138	8.50	Took with McKee. Is a hell of a lot of memorization, on average each lecture has 50 slides and is densely packed with chemical and physiological information. Averages on quizzes/exams are chronically low due to the sheer volume of information. Interesting class, dedicate a lot of time to this 	9	3/17/2022
		Taken with Dr. Mckee. This class was super interesting, but incredibly dense and information heavy. Strong emphasis on memorization. Difficult weekly quizzes with notoriously low averages and exams that follow an FRQ experimental design based format. Study hard!!! Write extremely detailed notes and you should be fine.	8	4/5/2023
BIEN140A	1.00	I took it with Dr.McKee and this class was extremely easy. It was a straight Biomaterials memorization class.	1	3/28/2020
		Dr. McKee is one of the sweetest and most caring professors. The class is incredibly easy. 	1	3/31/2021
		taken with noshadi, who is very nice but a little inconsistent between slides/lectures due to disorganization. mostly memorization, pay attention to lectures to catch the discrepancies between his words said in lectures vs. his slides (his speech/lecture would be the accurate one), and you will be okay	1	4/10/2023
BIEN140B	4.00	More challenging than 140A but only barely. Put effort into the weekly literature reviews.	4	4/5/2023
BIEN142	6.00	Typically taught by Dr. Park. Not an easy A, but really fascinating material if you're interested in optics/biomedical imaging. He gives you everything you need to succeed on the HW and exams as long as you focus and ask good questions.	6	4/5/2023
BIEN155	7.00	The labs are easy enough, but unnecessarily time consuming due to waiting around for limited equipment. The lab reports are gnarly but necessary for performing well on the final group presentation.	7	4/5/2023
BIEN167	1.50	Long live Dr. Grover. This class was graded purely on 3 extremely easy and fun projects. All of my friends and I ended with a perfect score.	2	4/5/2023
		Taken with Grover Fall 2022, it was an easy A considering Grover is the most considerate/thoughtful/nice prof in BIEN at UCR. You will be assigned to 3 projects, the lectures are not graded based on attendance, and you just have to show up to the 3 activities in your own time and complete them before the quarter ends. The 3 projects are consisting of microfluidics and microscopic activities, and one presentation where you simulate your own microfluidic chip and how it would work with flow, and the TA will be there to help you out throughout all the activities. There are no HW assignments, just the 3 activities/projects.	1	4/10/2023
BIEN175A	7.50	Senior design is what you make of it. Choose your group and project VERY CAREFULLY. They will make or break your entire year. I took w Dr. Park and Dr. Mckee and their lectures were marginally helpful. Assignments were repetitive and time consuming.	7	4/5/2023
		Taken with Park/McKee co-teaching, and most of it was busy work (a lot of writing/documentation/literary research). Put a lot of time into going into office hours and ask questions so the professors think of you highly since most if not all skills acquired in senior design is self-taught (e.g., SolidWorks, MATLAB, etc.). Assign yourself to different tasks, be organized, and communicate with your teammates thoroughly. SD is tough in general just due to how BIEN is structured at UCR, but you can do it	8	4/10/2023
BIEN175B	8.00	Taken with Vullev/McKee Winter 2023, the brunt of this quarter for senior design is mainly the building of your device with your team, and programming it. There was an individual interview assigned at random on a weekly basis rotating through all the students to make sure you were doing equal work/not slacking, and you are graded heavily based on the individual interview and the presentation at the end of the quarter. At around week 8, there would be demos/presentations to show that your device could complete at least one (+points if <1) functionality, and you could explain to the rest of the class why this functionality is important/significant. There are also biweekly progress meetings with TAs you have to schedule in your own time, to update them on how far your device has gotten with progress.	8	4/10/2023
BIEN190	1.00	Taken with Grover (as part of his research lab) as Special Studies in Winter 2023. Depending on your prof/PI, you will be asked to submit a journal/apply+participate in a research event (like the Undergraduate Research Symposium, or Undergraduate Mini-Grant), requiring you to show up in lab for at least 12 hours a week. Grover wasn't strict about the hours nor the topic presented at the Symposium, so long that all of his undergrads get involved with industry professionals for better of their futures. No assignments, no exams, just deadlines running on UGR schedule (which does not update online often so be vigilant about the deadlines)	1	4/10/2023
BIEN234	8.00	Took w Dr. Nam. Bar none my favorite class so far. Material was engaging and incredibly fascinating. Exams were challenging and assessed genuine comprehension of the lectures. It was easy to put in substantial effort into this course because I woke up excited to attend. 	8	4/5/2023
BIOL002	2.80	Cellular basis of life, taken with Quinn McFrederick. Class itself isn't too difficult. It's biology for non-majors so no-one expects too much of you. General intro to biology course. Labs require a lab coat though, which is fun. Midterms and final aren't too bad, just study mastering biology and the previous in class material and you'll be fine.	4	12/13/2017
		Took the class with Maslov. Maslov only had exams, but you'll be fine even if you never went to lecture by simply studying the slides as well as the past midterms he provides for the respective midterms. Labs were easy, since you never really do anything complicated and could just follow the lab manual step by step, and most of the time, they were short and you'll be leaving early. 	3	3/26/2018
		Took this with McFrederick. The midterm and finals are based on previous homeworks and quizzes and they are open notes. Class is pretty free as long as you do the quizzes and homeworks. Homeworks and quizzes have unlimited tries and they take the highest scores so basically full points on both categories. Labs are extremely easy as long as you follow the instructions which aren't difficult at all.	3	12/22/2021
		Took the class with Lucy Delaney and the course was really easy. Only 5 quizzes throughout the course for the lecture, which is 70% of your grade, and the other 30% comes from lab. Lots of extra credit opportunities to bump you up as much as 15% if you decide to do everything. Easy A class if you need a biology as a breadth requirement.  	2	6/16/2022
		Professor McFrederick is hands down one of the best professors at UCR. In my four years at this university, I've never met a more passionate professor than him and I'm not even a biology major. I wish more professors were like him and were passionate about the subject rather than trying to weed out students with their hard tests and assignments. Dr. McFrederick really cares and is a cool person and generally wants everyone to succeed and have a greater appreciation for biology than before you took his class.	2	11/30/2022
BIOL003	5.50	Took it with Spasojevic/Regan. Pretty easy A if you studied for the exams and understood the labs. None of the labs took all three hours and weren't too hard, they were just repetitive. The exams were pretty straightforward but there is definitely a lot of information that needs memorization. There were clickers but they didn't dock off points for getting the question wrong and they gave full points if you got at least 70%. I missed a couple of classes but was still able to get the full points.	8	3/13/2019
		Had Marko Spasojevic. He posts the slides after every lecture. One quiz every week (no matter what you get you will get full credit for just attempting it). Two midterms and one final (all of them being multiple choice). As long as you review the slides given and retain some of that information, it is a pretty easy class. Labs: Be sure to read the lab handout before class as there will be a quiz at the beginning of every lab covering information from that week's lecture and from the given handout. Beware of Scott Mondrala, he's an older dude and drags on class for much longer than needed. He knows his stuff but is not the best teacher. 	3	2/12/2022
BIOL005A	6.52	Maslov is an easy professor. Test averages 60-70	7	3/26/2017
		Just go to lecture and actually pay attention	6	3/29/2017
		I found this class to be the easiest of the series. Take Nothnagel/Martins-Green if you can. Their curve is generous and they're very nice people. 	1	4/3/2017
		Read the book and go over posted powerpoints.  Maslov and Kaloshian post practice problems too, so go over those to get a feel of the midterm/final styles.  No need to go to class if you read the material.	6	3/30/2017
		"I had it with Maduro -- he is doing this new system where he made ~50 videos covering the material, and instead of having lectures has the videos due semiweekly (with ""clicker"" quiz questions inside) and holds office hours for lecture. I actually really enjoyed it, most of my friends didn't attend lecture if it was their first class and still got A's (I got an A-). One thing to watch out for is he will try to trick you on the midterms (all multiple choice): you will read the question, immediately know the answer, and when you get the midterm back realize you read it wrong! Be sure to read each midterm question carefully, and if you are choosing ""the obvious answer"" read the question and think of the concept carefully. Beyond that, he is hilarious, the videos are hilarious, but the lecture/OH is a bit boring (he repeats himself... a lot). Still, most I know really struggle with Bio 5A, Maduro knows this and tries to give us as much help as possible without throwing A's at us. He'll give you every exam he's ever written (some going back to 2006 I think?), do them all! Oh, and a pro-tip I wish I discovered sooner: the video have a ""view captions"" tab, and most of the quiz questions (which halt the video) are discussed right after in the script, so you can look there ""to confirm your answer""."	6	8/24/2018
		This was the hardest class out of the BIOL005 series for me, as it was extremely focused on chemistry. I took it with Sarjeet Gill and Omar Akbari; Gill was a good professor but he went so fast during lecture while Akbari was the opposite and Akbari's slides were a mess. Akbari seemed like he was extremely passionate in teaching but you can be as passionate as you want and still be a not so great professor	9	9/11/2018
		Class was split between Katayoon Dehesh and Maneula Martins-Green. While Dehesh was a bit all over the place, her test questions were more straight-forward than MMG, whose questions are more similar to AP Bio questions.	7	2/19/2019
		Not hard but covers a lot of material in a short amount of time. Just stay on top of your studying and you should be fine. Had Dr. Adler and Dr. Mauck. There were 3 midterms, a final, and no homework. 	6	3/7/2019
		Took it with Dr. Dillman and Dr. Mauck. I prefered Dillman of the two becuase kahoot really allowed you to pinpoint what you knew. Mauck had activities that layed out all the sequences though. Other than that you dont really need to go to lecture. Had 3 midterms and a final, all of which i thought were pretty straightforward. Just study outside of class, do well in discussion, and you should be good.	6	3/24/2019
		This class was extremely hard. Points only stemmed from quizzes, two midterms and one final. Don't mess up on any of them as it will extremely affect your grade in the end.	9	3/25/2019
		Took it with Dr.Gil. One of the most tedious classes. Covers lots of material, so make sure to read the book and get all the concepts down. I think we had one midterm and one final. The problems were multiple choice, but they were very specialized on the comprehension of processes and concepts.	8	6/8/2019
		Take Maduro's version if you can. His averages are higher, he gives a ton of his past exams with answers, and you do not have to go to class. But definitely you have to be self-motivated to do the weekly videos which count for points. His exams test for real undrstanding and he gives new questions each time so you can't just memorize the old tests. The videos are straight forward/to the point and I saved a ton of time by doing them on my own and skipping the classes. THis is totally the way an intro Bio course should be done, sitting in a class watching someone go through a bunch of powerpoints in an hour doesn't really work and Maduro gets that.	6	8/4/2019
		DO NOT TAKE WITH MARTINS GREENS. study the book and go to class or you wont do well.	7	9/23/2019
		Had Professor Ray Andasknar and Professor Alder Dilman. Dilman taught the first half, and his midterm was pretty straight forward. If you read the reading notes and looked over the notes for Dilman his exam wasn't bad. For Professor Ray it was a harder midterm because he kinda cant word things good (ex. grammar issues) but they aren't bad either. For him you're gonna need to put in more effort though. The final wasn't bad, but don't cram for the final as it was worth a lot. Overall, 5A material isn't hard you just have to make the time to study which is what gets to people.   	6	12/12/2019
		Had Dahesh and Martins-Green. Dahesh is charismatic and made the lectures engaging. Martins-Green seems to get a bad rep, but I think she means well and really wants students to learn. Overall I didn’t find lectures to be enough and needed to read the book. Exams are multiple choice. Midterms were about the same difficulty but final had more convoluted questions imo. 	7	5/8/2020
		Took it with Dehesh and Martins-Green (Dehesh for the 1st half, Martins-Green for the 2nd). Both use clickers in class and the questions sometimes end up being on the exams. Dehesh's exams were way more straightforward and Martins-Green's exams required slightly more analyzing (similar to AP Bio questions in high school) but were still manageable. Reading the textbook helps a lot with filling in the details because both professors go over topics very generally (especially towards the end). Personally, I found this class relatively manageable but that's most likely because I've taken gen bio courses before. 	3	5/8/2020
		Very hard and conceptual test questions given with a very limited time frame! Wish I had more time to finish the tests! Also wish the teacher taught more material	9	5/10/2020
		took this class w/ professor Maduro during spring 2020, even though I enjoyed the recorded lectures and ability to earn points through them, his tests were extremely difficult for me. The tests were not similar at all with the practice exams. If you want to pass, you NEED to study, and really grasp the application of the concepts.	7	6/9/2020
		Maduro is picky so u have to really try to get an A average was a 54 percent for most tests and that ended up being a B	7	6/10/2020
		Maduro is the best professor, esp how he formats the class. His class could get difficult, but do the practice exams and that should help a ton	7	8/1/2020
		[COVID-19 SPRING 20] Took this class ONLINE with Ryan Joseph and Zhenbiao Yang. Both professors are very nice and passionate about their field. Joseph is an exceptional teacher and organizes his slides in a very efficient and easy to understand way. I definitely learned more from Joseph. Some of the information he teaches coincides with what you learn in Chem 1B (for the first few weeks at least). Yang is not as good in terms of clarity and presentation of information, but he will gladly answer questions and explain topics more thoroughly if need be. Both professors opted for online videos that you could watch at any time. Yang held his Zoom lecture at the scheduled time, but also uploaded said lecture online. There are two midterms and a final and it was all open book. As long as you take detailed notes from the slides, you will earn a good grade. 	5	8/26/2020
		Took Martins-Green/Dehesh in Winter 2021. Honestly, I was struggling during the class. I barely understood what was being said, despite reading the book chapters assigned. Definitely skip. Grade is based on discussion, two midterms, and a final. 	9	3/19/2021
		Had it with Mauck/Atkinson. Mauck is pretty good but Atkinson isn't the best lecturer as he goes on tangents and isn't very focused. The class grading is very generous as discussion is 35% of the class and its easy to get an A+. Still recommend	6	3/19/2021
		LOVE Professor Delaney wish we had her the whole quarter but they switched off halfway to Professor Atkinson. Delaney is literally the sweetest and the best professor I've had at UCR so far. She makes the lecture really interesting and you can tell the effort she puts into her slides. I also really loved her lecture style and annotating on the slides. Atkinson, on the other hand, it was really hard to pay attention during class. He said a lot of words but none of them were getting through to me. His slides are really cluttered and confusing and his voice is so monotone. But both their exams are pretty easy. No homework :)) I don't know if that was a good thing or bad.	7	3/18/2022
		had it with maslov and martins-green. Maslov is a good professor but martins green is pretty difficult and her lectures are hard to follow. she has unreasonable expectation of students and thinks everyone wants to cheat. try to avoid	8	5/23/2022
		I took it with Professor Sachs. He's chill at doing lectures and office hours, but for his exams are pretty tough due to questions being too ambiguous that there's no clear answer choice to answer them. It's more like select the best answer choice and there's some questions that are none of the above as potential correct answer. I would recommend go over the practice exam qs, attend his office hours where he'll do more practice exam qs, go to SI, attend TA's office hours, and simplify lecture materials/concept for easy memorization. He also do extra credits (10 points max) that'll make a huge difference for your grades where you ask him a question in lecture and he'll give you extra credit slip (earn only one per lecture). Overall course is based on 2 midterms, weekly discussion quizzes and hw, and 1 final. There's grade cut-off where getting 80% out of total will be considered as A-. Take him as an alternative option if you don't find a good BIOL005A professor.	7	12/7/2022
		Had with giraldo and martins-green. Giraldo was great, she told us everything that was expected of us and put all her content on slides. MG is pretty difficult, lectures are confusing, expects you to remember examples that she doesn't include on slides, and her exam questions are application heavy and confusing. 	8	12/28/2022
BIOL05LA	5.43	Quizzes are easy and short multiple choice questions.  Lab exercise grades depend on pickiness of TA.  Final sucked hard--it had material that wasn't learned in class.  Whoever wrote it didn't have good English skills either.	6	3/30/2017
		Overall not too hard. Actually try on the worksheets and read the lab manual before each lab and you should be fine. Final is difficult and dropped me 6% but the curve brought me back up to an A.	5	3/24/2019
		Overall, the labs were easy but my TA was too harsh on grading. Final was also really focused on the expected results per lab.	7	3/25/2019
		The lab portion itself is easy. You do worksheets in the class and the material correlates a lot to lecture so it helps with the learning process. The prelab quiz are really easy and a quick skim though the lab manual you can get full credit on those quizzes. For the 3 major quizzes thought the quarter, really focus on the results and the procedures and look over the worksheets and you will be good. This quarter (Fall 2019) I thought the lab final was cake, as it was just all the worksheets and the practice exam that were on the exam, but do study if you want high grade. I think they might've change the 5LA final because people previous quarters told me it was very difficult and stuff on it wasn't learned, but that wasn't the case this quarter.	5	12/12/2019
		Labs are easy, but my TA graded harshly and people rarely got full credit on assignments. Worksheets are straightforward and the 3 bigger quizzes emphasized results. I’d study learning objectives, review results and the reasoning, not many calculations or stuff about procedure. Overall, I was more worried about my lab grade than the actual class grade which is lame.	7	5/8/2020
		It was very easy don't stress about it 	2	12/6/2021
		BIOL05LA labs are easy but very time consuming to do where some experiments take longer to do it along with answering the lab worksheet qs. It depends, but you have to draw diagrams of lab experiment's procedures as pre-labs. There's some point where you have to do exactly as the procedure tells you to not screw up, and there's some cases where you might have to re-do the lab experiment in case of mishaps. In addition, sometimes the TA grading are weird/ a bit harsh as they mark off points for some worksheet qs that are wrong despite your answers are correct but looks wrong. So, re-read the lab manual and make sure that you can find the answer of the worksheet qs from the lab manual. Midterm and Final are mostly conceptual from what you are learning while doing the labs, not based on procedures of the lab. Lastly, 1 group project at the end of the quarter based on fish frauds through DNA labs. 	6	12/7/2022
BIOL005B	7.78	Heavy memorization 	8	3/26/2017
		Avoid Chappell at all costs. This class is challenging regardless of the professor but Chappell makes it absolute hell. I've heard that Redak is still kind of hard, so keep your guard up around him too. 	10	3/31/2017
		Avoid Chapell if he's still teaching. His tests are extremely difficult 	9	3/29/2017
		Make sure you know everything on the notes. And I mean everything	8	3/29/2017
		It was incredibly difficult because there is a lot of information that you must memorize. It is a requirement for most CNAS students and some BCOE students but overall it was an interesting class, but lots to memorize!	9	4/1/2017
		Redak's material was hard.  Study for the final.	6	8/10/2017
		Had Regan/Hammond. No curve that would help your grade. Regan gets questions from the textbook. Hammond creates her own questions. Pure memorization. Hardest out of the BIOL 5 Series. Its normal to retake the class.	9	12/31/2017
		Much tougher than Biol005A as there is a lot much information to learn. Understanding the main ideas, trends, and applying them are key to succeeding in this course. 	7	6/15/2018
		Extremely hard if you get Chappel	8	9/3/2018
		Chappell is the destroyer of GPAs. 	10	11/21/2018
		This class is hard in general, heavy memorization and application. Everyone says to avoid Chappel but honestly hes a good teacher and his curve got me an A. Make sure you got all clicker points, and a very high grade in the lab.	9	12/12/2018
		Took it with Dr. Chappell. One of the hardest classes I’ve ever taken, he covers so much material during lectures and he has extremely hard clicker questions. He tends to ask questions that require a very high level of comprehension of material. Two midterms, one final. I remember scoring class average (20%) but huge curve saved us!	10	6/8/2019
		Had Redak, his exams are based on his lectures but will force you you to think outside the box most of the time. Trust your gut.	8	6/15/2019
		I thought it was harder than BIOL005A because there is a lot to memorize since most of what we learn is about animal and plant diversity. Definitely stay on top of studying/reading because it's a lot to memorize.	8	6/15/2019
		Took with Santiago and Campbell. The class average on the final was 57% and the curve will likely help me pass. Lab is the key to passing. Don’t slack off in lab. Heavy memorization and less application based than 5A	9	6/15/2019
		Took it with Redak. There's a ridiculous amount of information to memorize and his questions are messy and really test your conceptual understanding of the material. However, getting a good grade is completely doable as long as you keep up with the material. Pay attention to small details in the slides. Going to lecture helped a lot in pin pointing what would be on exams, but he mainly just reads off slides so its not completely necessary. He said he wouldn't curve, but most of my friends ended up with half a letter grade higher than expected. However, I wouldn't rely on this as I know he did not curve the quarter before I took the class.	9	6/20/2019
		Study the slides given in class and you will do well. I had santiago and got an A. Also make sure to do well in Lab those are easy points.	3	9/23/2019
		Class is not bad. However, make sure to study consistently. Also, there is a curve usually if you take the class with Santiago.	6	12/10/2019
		Multiple choice for all test questions. If you have Mauck, her tests are more analysis of the material rather than memorization. If you have Atkinson, his tests are more memorization than analysis - he uses questions from the practice tests sometimes or similar ones. Stephanie is a great TA - stick with her if you end up getting her. In general tho - TOPIC NOTES. They save your life.  	7	3/27/2020
		5B was a trip. Definitely hardest of the series in terms of the amount of material you're expected to know. BUT I had Ryan Joseph who is a LEGEND for 5B. His lecture notes are really organized and structured in a very clean and organized way that made studying for this class easier and not have to scramble through slides and whatnot. He also post study questions for each lecture that are crucial for doing good on the test. This is a memorization class but his questions really helped you pinpoint what you should know for the exams as his exams were fair and reflected the study questions he posted. Rack as many points as you can in lab because if you do good in lab it really boost your overall grade. I would highly recommend Ryan Joseph for 5B as this truly is a weeder class.	9	3/30/2020
		Had it with Redak/Campbell Spring 2020. They were really nice and understood what everyone was going through. The class was hard as everyone made it seem - lots of memorization especially the first half. It gets easier when you get out of the animal section. You could get A's on the exams by memorizing the lectures, I didn't open the book once the entire quarter. 	8	6/12/2020
		Took it with Meyer Summer 2020. Lectures and slides were clear and he is helpful in office hours. Meyer was also extremely fair with grading. Tests were not difficult if you studied (they were also open note because of remote learning). I thought the content was easier than Bio 5A. Lab and homework was super easy too. Grading scale: 45% Tests (15% per exam), 35% HW, 20% Lab. 	5	9/5/2020
		"(Fall 2020 Online) I gave this a 8/10 in difficulty. This class is HEAVY MEMORIZATION and there is so so so so so so so much information. It's not the professors fault honestly, it's just what this class entails. You also have to be able to build upon information. I took it with Dr. Scott Kelly. He does recorded lectures with set of notes and holds live office hours. The videos can be long and kind of boring because of his monotone voice. I recommend you read the notes before you start the videos, that way you learn and retain more during the videos. There are 2 noncumulative midterms, 3 noncumulative quizzes, and 1 cumulative final. Please take this class seriously and study at least one week before each exam or quiz. Dr. Kelly did a great job of providing ""What you need to know"" slides at the end of each lecture so that you can really pinpoint what to study. There is NO CURVE and NO EC. I also recommend doing well on the very first midterm as that will set the stage and also get 100% on your lab portion as that is 25% of your final grade and can really give you that boost. I somehow scraped by with a B. "	8	12/28/2020
		had it with santiago and delaney spring 2022! very good combo theyre the best :) extra credit and they tell you exactly what u need to know for the exams. try to take them!! no cumulative final; just 4 exams	5	5/23/2022
		Had Delaney, she's a really good prof. She lists everything that we will need to know for the exams. Material itself isn't hard, it's mostly just memorization	6	10/28/2022
		memorization heavy, so far the hardest class I've taken in college and required a lot of study hours. the tests are super hard and the lab TAs really control your grade so if you have a harsh lab ta its really hard to do well. destroys gpas	9	3/28/2023
BIOL05LB	4.33	Do worksheets and get easy points that go to lecture grade.	4	8/10/2017
		My TA was Sabbir Ahmed (spring 2020). He didn't answer any questions during the zoom labs which made it really hard to understand the worksheets especially as we couldn't do the lab in person. Otherwise a cool dude, just didn't adapt well. 	5	6/12/2020
		(Fall 2020 Online) I gave this class a 4/10 in difficulty because it was a pretty straight forward lab. Just do the assigned reading chapters and you will literally get 100% on all the quizzes as the questions are picked from the chapter. The worksheets are also straight forward and the TA sometimes goes over them in class so that you are able to check your answers. This lab is worth 25% of your final BIOL005B Lecture so do well!! It can really make a difference between a C and a B-.	4	12/28/2020
BIOL005C	5.13	Easiest of the bio 5 series	4	3/26/2017
		Easiest in the series, just keep up with it. Make sure to know the notes at least	5	3/29/2017
		Pretty easy stuff.  Know the calculations portion.  Nunney and Rafferty were pretty good.	5	12/15/2017
		Easiest of the series. Took with Rafferty and Nunney. Just make sure you study a lot of people get cocky and end up doing poorly on the 2nd midterm and final because of it.	5	12/18/2018
		Took Nunney and Rafferty (not sure about spelling) Keep up with the lectures and you should be fine. 	3	12/20/2018
		Had Prof. Rankin (teaches first 5 weeks/Ecology), and Prof. Stouthamer (teaches last 5 weeks/Evolution). Overall, wasn't all that bad. We had three tests total; two midterms and a final. All were multiple choice. Rankin's portion was slightly harder because we had to analyze graphs and make sure to know when to apply certain formulas (but she always gave us a formula bank so that was good!). Stouthamer's portion was -personally- a bit more boring, but if you study his slides you'll get by alright. Pulled a B+ but I believe an A is definitely doable. Lab portions are easy.	7	3/29/2019
		I think I got a relatively bad grade but I really neglected studying for this course bc it really is one of those you can get away with skipping lecture and cramming with. I took it with Michael Anderson/Bai-Lian Li. 	6	12/15/2019
		Relatively easy class. Took it with Rafferty/Degnan. Rafferty content is super easy while Degnan is much more difficult and dense. No books required, only clickers. Grades are about 70% exams, 10% clicker, 20% lab. Two midterms, both worth 10-15%. Final is a big chunk being about 45%. Lab portion super easy. 	5	12/16/2019
		Huge step down from BIOL 005B. Studying for this class is much easier than it was for BIOL 005B. For the lab portion, your grade in lab is highly dependent on participation and this final  group project. The group project is pretty easy as long as you have a good group and an easy project. The exams were not too difficult to study for, but for the final exam, make sure to study the lab portion because there will be 10 questions from the lab portion that is not covered in lecture. 	3	12/18/2019
		Only reason why I gave this such a high difficulty is because the professors are complete assholes when it comes to grading for 5C. Please for the love of everything do not take Prof. Ponisio, this quarter was hell in 5C cause of her and her lying and unprofessionalism. Prof Hansen for Evolution was more understanding and more content on her notes so studying for her part of the class was easier. 5C material is the easiest of the series and the professors know that students push this class on the backburner so they make the grading scale harder than of 5B and 5A. If you study consistently then you can easily get an A, but I studied the night before the exams and walked out with a B. 	8	6/16/2020
		Not a hard class, but don’t neglect it, as information piles on fast. 4 tests so you do have tests often, but material is not cumulative so its not too bad	3	12/19/2020
		Genetics and evolution. Pretty digestible concepts and easy math. If you took AP Bio, this is review. Very cram-worthy considering midterms (2) and the final were taken almost directly from the slides. Never attended lecture and did fine. Barry Li and Ring Carde.	4	1/4/2021
		"Class is chill. Not a cake walk, but chill. Most professors are fine. You'll be fine in this class. The ONLY exception is a professor named Ring Carde. DO NOT take this class with Ring Carde because when I had him as a professor, the entire class panicked for the final. 

- He is a boomer when it comes to technology (he posted 3 hours videos because he forgot to stop the recording after the first hour, and would make an announcement to the class saying ""I dont know why this upload is taking forever"" yeah well its because you forgot to record so the file is massive). His final also showed the answers early, so if you were on the phone with someone else while taking the exam and one person turns it in, they can tell you what is correct and incorrect which I think everyone didn't expect.
- His videos were boring and the slides were poorly made (you would see text boxes all over the place)
- He was supposed to be giving out quizzes but completely ignored the syllabus, other professor (Larry Li) had to take care of that mess
- His final exam was completely incorrect on more than several questions. The slide had WORD FOR WORD the opposite statement to the answer on the exam which he did not correct. He actually only corrected one single question...
- When we emailed him about the final, he didn't respond to a single email (everyone was talking to each other at this point).

I don't doubt he's a passionate guy nor do I think he's a bad person. But when he taught BIOL005C for me in Fall 2020, he was the worst professor I have ever had (and I'm about to graduate as I write this, no one was worse than him). Please drop that class IMMEDIATELY if you see him teaching BIOL005C (maybe other subjects he's fine, and not online). You will not get a good experience."	8	11/19/2022
BIOL020	5.83	Equivalent to BIOL05LA, so you won't need to take BIOL05LA if you take this class. If you're taking this class, you most likely won't have a choice in who you get in terms of professor and TA. Useful class since it teaches you the basics in lab techniques and equipment. Be prepared to learn beyond what you may expect in regular biology. At the end of the class, students are expected to give a presentation about their project and a paper about the same project (project would be given to you by professors in the class; you will understand what this means when you get to that point in the class). 	8	12/14/2018
		Took with Alex Cortez, but most of the grading is done by the TA, which, depending on how picky they are, can make or break your grade in the class. Better lab experience than BIOL 05LA, but a lot of work for a 2 unit class. 	7	2/19/2019
		One of the hardest classes I've taken at UCR...a lot of work for a 2 unit class. Took a lot time that could've been used to study for other hard classes. Save yourself the time and take BIOL05LA instead. 	9	3/23/2019
		As long as you do the homework and understand it well, you should be fine. The best way to succeed in this class is by doing the problems over and over again until you understand it. 	6	6/16/2019
		My professor was Alex Cortez. The first half of the course isn't too bad, but sometimes the lab writeups take some time to do. This class is kind of like a biotechnology/intro to research stuff class since you do PCR and gel electrophoresis a lot. Just make sure to understand the concepts since the midterm and final is all application. People generally do bad on the midterm, but better on the final. The second half of the course was focused on a research project for an actual research lab, where you had to really understand the experimental design and do a lab report and presentation. This class is good experience for those interested in research.	6	12/15/2019
		Lots of work in the class.  Heavily dependent on how hard your TA is.  	7	12/19/2019
		One of the best classes on campus!! Yes, its hard work and sleepless nights and a class full of confused faces but I believe this class has shaped me into the person I am today. If ur concerned about ur GPA don't take this class. 	8	12/20/2019
		Had Burnette. I love the man in that he's super nice and you can tell he really likes what he teaches. Provides a lot of advice and is great at answering questions. Just pay attention in class and read the experiment PDFs he provides. 	5	12/18/2020
		Great class if you're into research. Read and take notes of material before each class. Had Dr. Chetty and she's alright. Huge curve at the end of the quarter. I finished off with a B- and my grade went to an A- but I'm not sure if it is because we took it online during a pandemic or if grades are usually curved.	7	12/21/2020
		Dr. Burnette is super chill and the class isn't an issue. The quizzes and midterm are super straightforward-- I would never study and get 100's on everything because he only tests on general facts in his lectures. You learn a lot of introductory lab processes and it was genuinely my favorite class of the quarter. 	1	11/15/2021
		Took with Alex Cortez. A lot of the material on the quizzes, midterms, and final were not discussed in class, so make sure to do the readings. They are also very application heavy. The first half of the class is intro to a lot of techniques used in the second part of the class, which is an actual research lab. The research we were doing wasn't explained to us well and I had to look up a lot of terms and concepts from the procedure. You have to do a lab report and a presentation about it. Alex was pretty lenient with grading but our TA wasnt. Overall a really great class for getting involved with research	3	12/28/2022
		I took this class Fall 2022 with Alex Cortez. Very kind and accommodating teacher. To do well in the class, read all of the lab backgrounds and asks lots of questions to fully understand the material. The quizzes, midterms, and final often contain free response questions somewhat similar to lab conclusion questions, true or false based on definitions found in the readings, drawing diagrams and the PCR results depending on different scenarios, and also fill in the blanks. When asked to design an experiment, most of the time remember to include PCR analysis and running gel electrophoresis because that was the main focus of the class. I had Aimee and Archie as my TA and lab assistant and they were super helpful and sweet. Pretty easy grading on end of quarter project presentation (average was 93 in our class) and project research paper was canceled because of TA strike. Alex also offered 20 EC points at the end of the quarter and a lot of people ended the class with at least an A despite not doing well on the first few quizzes. Did not regret this class at all. 	3	3/3/2023
BIOL030	4.00	As long as you kind of pay attention during notes/studying the slides on your own, you will likely pass this class. Very little study required even for an A if you are good at memorizing facts/anatomy.	2	6/11/2019
		I have a bit of a bad taste from this class but it I took it because it was supposed to be an easy A. Class is more for younger people that don't have much sexual education from classes and personal experience. TA made discussion an absolute chore to get through. I got an A but I realized a little too late that I didn't need to work that hard to get it. LOTS of fluffer points from discussions, quizzes, and assignments.	4	12/19/2019
		Professor Kahn was pretty good. The class was pretty interesting even though plenty of people seemed uncomfortable every moment we were in discussion. The exams were open note and I did well overall. Would recommend to most.	6	12/28/2020
		Took this during Fall 2020 (virtual), asynchronous lectures, weekly mandatory discussion. open note quizzes, midterm, and final. Only 2 assignments and they were pretty straightforward, 	4	12/28/2020
		Took this class during covid with Professor Kahn. I am giving the class a 4 because even though the assignments, exams, and everything was easy you needed virtually all of the points to actually get an A. She claims that she doesn't curve the class at all. The class was out of 500 points and there wasn't any homework. You can really not mess up on any assignment or there goes your A. 	4	5/25/2021
BIOL040	3.00	"Class is History of Infectious Diseases Took over the Summer with Eleana Guardado. The material isn't super easy, but definitely not hard. Definitely easy as far as BIO classes go. All quiz and exam answers are from the slideshows she posts on iLearn. There were 3 ""projects"" during the quarter: a timeline of events you make from the slideshows, a ""diary"" about the diseases we learn about, and a very short ""essay"" about a disease of your choice. The material is SO interesting, especially during a pandemic. "	3	9/30/2021
BIOL102	6.80	Legitimately not that hard.  Many complain Maslov doesn't really teach but learning genetics is mostly rote memorization and practice.  You're just getting the basic principles down.  He provides lots of practice problems and old exams, so if you go through those and understand the problems, you're guaranteed an A.	5	12/17/2018
		Had David Nelson for this class. His lectures are useful, but it is very important to read the book in order to do well, as he takes a lot of concepts from the book for his exams. Generous curve, so if you study hard you should be able to get an A.	7	5/18/2020
		Had Gachomo for the first half and her teaching consists of reading the slides while the midterms consists of material we rarely went over. Her midterms not only cheated our time but she would have so many questions that were impossible for many students to finish in the time allotted. Bachant was an amazing professor in the second half. Definitely understood the struggle of the students and thoroughly went through the material. The material itself isn't that hard except that if you miss a part then it gets slightly confusing. 	7	6/25/2020
		Took with Dr. Arthur Jia Spring 2021. AMAZING professor he truly cares for his students and wants you to do well. Ample opportunities for office hours and midterm review. HOWEVER, his two midterms were short answer, fair, and closed book. Final was 25 mc closed book. Class is graded on a class scale (20-25% get A's etc.)	7	6/7/2021
		I took it in the Spring of 2021 and had both Gachomo and Roose. Gachomo has much simpler concepts to go over so she makes her midterm questions harder. Roose has much harder concepts to go over. Both are pretty bad professors and I came out of genetics not knowing anything. If you take Roose my advice is to memorize his slides and make it through midterms. Do not take him if you want to actually learn genetics.	8	11/9/2021
BIOL104	See BPSC104			
BIOL105	5.00	No homework is due, it’s hard to stay on track as all material is asynchronous, but 95% of the midterms and final questions come verbatim from the lecture practice questions. 	5	12/19/2020
BIOL107A	7.40	I don't think the material was hard but it was having Dr.Chen as a professor. He can get off track easily and disorganized. He said he is changing the class layout next time he teaches because he found out that his class correlates with BIOL 121 a little too much.	7	3/31/2017
		Chen and Jin were a little difficult to understand (accents). Jin's midterm had some stuff we covered in the second half rather than the first. Chen gives you possible things that will be covered on the final but not all of it will appear. The good thing is that you can bring in a full sized cheat sheet for the final. The curve was legendary.	7	4/1/2019
		The class is not easy. It is difficult and time intensive. Also, there is barely any curve in this class with Hailing Jin, so avoid taking the class with her.	7	4/2/2021
		"This class is HARD, but it is a hard class in general. Personally I loved Dr. Nagel. Her content was straight forward, if you watched the lecture, studied, and wrote notes, you will be fine. I watched her lectures, wrote it in a notebook, and made a quizlet for each week and went to office hours. I got almost a 100 percent on every test because I put in effort. This is NOT a class you can just slide by in. You have to put in major effort.
 Though, Dr. Nagels material for the tests were all from the her slides, and there are only 35-40 slides per lecture. Take her over the other professors if you want to learn the material and have a clear shot of getting a good grade if you put in the effort. Please ignore bad reviews from her, she was great. 
Very exam heavy- 90% exams, 10% discussion quizzes, a possible 5% extra credit."	8	6/14/2022
		Don't take with Prof. Nagel. Her grading system isn't the best and she makes it super hard to accommodate to students for any missed exams or quizzes. Her exams weren't too bad if you studied but she would throw in a few curveballs. 107A isn't that hard but there is a lot to know, so if you study regularly then you'll be fine. I would study only two days in advance for exams and walked out w a B+ after her small curve. Recommend taking someone else tho	8	6/21/2022
BIOL108	7.00	Very interesting class; great professor and good curve; Lots of calculations and research articles to read in discussion	7	12/29/2020
BIOL115	8.00	This was a fascinating class (Human Genetics), one of the most interesting I took as a Bio major. You can't just memorize facts, you have to understand how things work and make predictions. Maduro also makes it impossible to cheat, he keeps class attendance through quizzes and has different exam and homework versions. But as hard as the course was, the average garde was a B or B- which is fair.	8	8/4/2019
		Maduro is the only one who teaches this class. He's kind of arrogant and wants you to know a lot of details. He provides all the notes, slides, and practice tests for his class on day 1 and his tests are open note (bc online learning), but it's definitely a hard class with a ton of material. His questions are worded extremely carefully and he has an algorithm that generates test questions so there's never the same question twice. 	8	3/17/2021
		This class is one of the most interesting classes iv'e ever taken and Maduro is super organized but he was really uptight and sucked at answering questions. You would go to office hours and he would not be able to dumb things down for you. he would constantly critique the class on how easy a topic was even though all of us were failing. The answers on the tests had like 10 answers all very similar too so you would have to know your shit. we had very little time for exams and no backtracking so most of the class didn't finish a couple questions but he's so stuck on not being able to collaborate/cheat he will not adjust this method. A average grade was a b to b- though, but you do not even know where you are in terms of the class until you see your grade on your transcript	8	4/15/2021
BIOL116	4.83	nice guy, talks slow, watch out for case studies in lecture	3	3/24/2019
		I had Anderson. Funny guy, laid back. Class was boring at times, but he showed a lot of videos. His exams sometimes require notes taken from his lectures. His slides are mostly pictures so you kinda have to go to know what he says. Avrg for midterms ~85%	3	5/5/2020
		took it with Nicole Rafferty. She is a sweetheart. The lectures are alright and her tests were straightforward. You should be as long as you go over the lecture notes.	4	6/7/2020
		Relatively easy class, open note exams, just requires regular studying	5	12/29/2020
		Took with Dr. Regan. It was fully online and exams were all open note. Lectures were asynchronous and most of them were 30 minutes or less. They provide a transcript along with each slide for convenience. Most content is pretty simple to understand. 45% of the grade consists of discussion attendance, quizzes (unlimited attempts), and discussion assignments which are all free points. Each midterm is worth 15% and the final is cumulative and worth 25%. Some of the exam questions are kind of detailed and requires you kinda dig through the lecture notes, but she said she does that since the exam is already open note, so you kinda got to be careful when reading the questions and referencing your notes. Each midterm has 25 questions in 50 minutes, so relying solely on digging through your notes may take up too much time. Averages were typically high, so no curve was needed. The final felt easier than the midterms and had the highest average.	4	3/24/2022
		took it with Rafferty. The class material is interesting if you like learning about conservation and biomes. Her slides are straight forward, but her exams are not. There is also PollEv so you will have to go to class. No curve. Only pointless rounding that doesn't do anything for your grade. This is an easy C+ or B-, not an easy A. Discussions are also really stupid because you don’t go over lecture material. All you do it read research papers or so stupid middle school activities. I say this because even the TA said she has no control over it and it was just busy work.	10	6/8/2022
BIOL119	6.75	Straightforward and a little difficult because memorization of slides and stuff is somewhat required. Good curve at the end of the class. Koenig and Chris are very nice and lab is simple as long as you pay attention to what is said.	5	4/1/2019
		This class is not difficult. However, Koenig is very lackluster at teaching. The lectures themselves are not very useful in getting a good grade in the course. But, the subject itself is very interesting.	6	4/2/2021
		DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Koenig is your typical unclear bad professor. Yeah sure we all have bad unclear professors, but they still make up for being bad teachers by making their tests reasonable or having a curve or even having fair cutoffs. He does NONE OF THAT. His midterms consist of free response and multiple choice, let's just say he is the harshest free response graders on the planet. The TA was horrible, could not speak english clearly at all (not to sound racist or anything). She tries to answer your questions but she never does a good job and you just end up more confused than ever. Both of their office hours are at unreasonable times and the day the week I was able to go to office hours, the TA on Monday announces that she will have her office hours on Tuesday. Like how unorganized can that be!! I dropped this class week 7 in the winter quarter, although I could not see if he did not curve or not, but I don't think that he will. His grade cutoffs were even ridiculous from the beginning. This class has been one of the worst classes I have taken at UCR.	9	2/16/2022
BIOL121	4.33	Take with Roper	3	2/5/2019
		This class was easy with Hsiao. Just focus on objectives and HW. Go to office hours and he'll tell you the extent of what he wants you to know. Second exam is the hardest so don't let your guard down. 100 pts extra credit available and a few % curve at the end.	4	3/7/2020
		The class is not difficult. Roper is not very good at lecturing and the class is heavy on memorization. There is barely any curve at the end of the course.	6	4/2/2021
BIOL121L	5.00	Professor Borneman taught this quarter. His exams are straight from his review slides, so if you memorize them you can easily get 100 on his exams. The most tedious part of this course is having to attend lab twice a week, in the first few weeks you will stay the entire 3 hour time slot, but in the latter half of the quarter you will only need to be there for an hour or so. Lecture meets once a week, these past two quarters at 8 AM so don't sleep in for exams. Overall, lecture/exam portion is easy, actual lab and lab reports are graded a little more strictly but an overall really fun class. Usually a requirement for PA school, nursing, and Optometry school.	5	6/9/2022
BIOL127	4.00	Took with Walton. Pretty dry with a lot of equations and charts for population dynamics, but not bad if you keep up with concepts. Formulas were provided on exams which helps. Multiple choice exams and Simutext software homework assignments and a group project.	4	2/18/2020
BIOL128	10.00	If this course is offered and is being taught by Raphael Zidovetski, DO NOT TAKE IT. The class is graded only by: 35% midterm and 65% final. He does not curve and is very inaccessible. He will probably not answer your emails or answer your questions directly in office hours. The class is asynch and the recordings are the same from 2020!!!! He has not changed the videos at all and even when asked to said he wouldn't. Exam wise, you get 2 questions for the midterm which involves having to reproduce entire immunological sequences and the final is 3 questions. Luckily the final was 2 questions from the review questions he provides and 1 new one. HOWEVER unless you're willing to memorize complex diagrams to reproduce them on your exam, do not take this class with him.	10	6/9/2022
BIOL132	See BPSC132			
BIOL155	10.00	I took this course with professor Lukaszewski and he failed the entire class for the final. There is no direct grading scale or textbook for the class. The midterms were essays which we could revise but there was no guidelines or rubric. The final was based on 10 questions pulled out of a 40 questions study guide. We answered the questions based on the content of his slides but they were still considered wrong. He is highly condescending and said his previous students were “bitching” about this class being hard. If you’re planning on graduating, avoid this professor at all costs. 	10	6/10/2022
BIOL157	5.67	Prof: Adler Dillman. Make sure you know all the parasites' life cycles and the assigned research paper very well. Midterms are about 60% questions on the parts of the life cycle and 40% questions from research paper. A lot of memorization in this class.	7	12/19/2017
		Loads of parasite life cycles to memorize.  Dillman also expects you to memorize the scientific papers he assigns as well.  Final wasn't great, but I don't expect much of a curve.  Also, we had to summarize a paper into kiddie language and got docked based on a nonexistent rubric posted after grades came out.  The TAs only gave verbal guidelines to it in discussion and didn't seem in consensus with even the prof about certain things.  Don't know why they didn't give us the breakdown in the first place so we would know exactly what to include. The final draft is only worth about half of discussion credit, but without a curve, any loss of points is extremely damaging to one's grade.	5	12/17/2018
		This class is an amazing class!!!! Dilman is one of the best professors in the biology department. Really good for premed students who want to learn about human parasites. Just memorize your life cycles and his slides, and you'll be chilling for a half of the midterms. The second half of the midterms are based on research papers he picks himself based on parasites studied in class. They are quite hard to read but actually give you a good scope of what most modern scientists do and is a quite different change of learning in college. Definitely would help prepare students for the MCAT especially because sections like bio/biochem require being comfortable with reading passages that are excerpts from primary research articles. The only problem with this class in my opinion is the research project that you have to analyze a research paper of your choice on a parasite you pick and dumb it down for 5th graders. Pretty pointless, but thats my only complaint.	5	2/17/2022
BIOL161A	7.00	Lots of memorization, but not the worst. Springer has easy questions, Reznick has hard questions: a + c, b + c, a + c... etc	7	12/14/2019
BIOL162	2.33	Extremely easy upper division class; took with Woodard; covers insect behavior and there are only 8 quizzes and no midterm or final exam	2	12/29/2020
		Woodard is the best! She's pretty sensitive to students' hardships and appreciates feedback. During remote learning, she did away with all exams, and focused on weekly quizzes/assignments, an insect picture collection, and a virtual presentation that were all WAY less stressful than they sound. 	1	12/30/2020
		"This class is awesome, IF YOU LIKE BUGS or are interested in the topics at hand. Professor Ysabel Giraldo is passionate about the topic and won't try to trick you, but many people took this as an ""easy"" class and were rudely awakened when they had to actually put in some effort. Nowhere near the effort of say, biochemistry, but certainly not en introductory course. Try to leave room in this class for people who are actually interested."	4	4/18/2023
BIOL163	5.50	This is by far one of the best biology upper divs UCR has to offer. The class is not hard, but very demanding. There are weekly field trips (you get 2 overnight trips), lab practicals (2), a project, and lecture exams. This class is a survey of mammals, birds, and reptiles (including dead specimen identification in lab and maybe some live specimens during the fieldtrips). If you are interested in any kind of field/conservation work this class is for you. You will learn to identify so many animals and learn cool facts that the knowledge will stay with you (I still remember things and it's been over a year). Super fun class and the professor is nice and accessible. 	8	11/4/2019
		Fun class with interesting material, field trips every weekend takes up a lot of time and energy	2	12/14/2019
		Took the class online. Field trips were fun to go on. Prof Clark is a really great lecturer and very accessible. This was probably one of the coolest classes I’ve taken. I’ve always been into wildlife and evolution, I imagine anyone who is would get a kick out of this class.	4	12/30/2020
BIOL171A	8.00	This class had two professors, Natalie Holt and Wendy Saltzman. This course was mainly online and the midterm and final were online and open-note. Not sure what would change if this was in-person. Midterms included multiple choice and free response questions. Take very detailed notes to study later. The test questions were framed after the lectures mainly. 	8	3/18/2022
BIOL174	7.00	Took it with Garland and it was pretty straightforward. All questions on the midterms and final came directly from the readings and lectures. He pretty much read from the lecture slides but overall was straightforward and really nice. There's a lot of memorization and he goes through info pretty quickly	7	3/19/2022
BIOL176	4.00	Fairly easy, basic math with physics concepts in a biological medium	4	12/14/2019
BIOL178	6.00	Class isn't hard honestly, I was just lazy and this was one of my 'easier' classes for the quarter. You do need to know the hormone cycles and basic info on her slides, so draw them out couple days before exam and doing her practice exams helped. Prof. Wendy is really nice and she is very understanding in these COVID times. I got average all both midterms and 100% in discussion and the annotated bibliography and walked out with a B- so I'd say that's fair. Get a good TA that will definitely boost your grade at the end. 	6	6/21/2022
BPSC011	1.50	open note class	1	12/14/2019
		Took Danelle Seymour. Laid back professor, lecture is a bit dry. Lecture recordings and slides are posted after every class, only discussion has manditory attendance. 3 quizzes (15 questions) - completely open book (written notes, electronic notes, the slides from class, the book are fair game), a recipe paper (3 pages on vegetables in your favorite recipe), a plant identification chart(fill in the blank paper for the botanical garden), and a group project (3-4 people doing a 12 minute presentation on a chosen fruit/vegetable - covering a variety google and wikipedia level research). easy class, only downside is having to hike up to the greenhouses - very steep walk. 	2	5/27/2022
BPSC021	6.00	Took with Professor Walling. This class wasn't too difficult, it is just mainly memorizing. Lots and Lots of memorizing as it is 5 units. It takes a lot of effort to study for the midterms which is a large chunk of your grade (25% for each three) because of the amount of content. If you start studying for each exam early via quizlet or your own flashcards, you are guaranteed a B. Lectures are in the morning, but going helps as the professor gives mystery questions that are on the exam and lectures help with memorizing exam content. Also, many questions that are on the exam are homework questions so look out for those! Would recommend, just make sure you have the time for it. 	6	4/7/2023
BPSC104	7.00	Do not take this for an easy A	7	7/7/2017
		While the material is generally pretty simple for an Upper div bio class, there is a lot to memorize and the class is test heavy, with 2 midterms, 2 practicals, quiz every week, and a final. Not bad but if all your looking for is an easy A look elsewhere.	7	12/17/2019
BPSC132	6.00	Not extremely difficult but also not an easy A. Study hard for the exams and lab practical and you'll do well. Springer is a great professor, and curves the final grades. 	6	3/28/2018
BPSC143	6.00	Juan Pablo is an awesome professor, and the test and quizzes are very fair, just study the notes. The one thing I will warn about the class is that the lab is a lot of work, but if you go the the TA for office hours they will help. While not the easiest A, some effort will make this classvery rewarding.	6	12/17/2019
BSWT001	3.00	easy class but many assignments	3	12/15/2020
BSWT002	3.00	Easy Class. it's a S class so don't really have to worry about anything. But there are many assignments in comparison to the regular english class. 	3	12/15/2020
BSWT003	6.80	Class is a remedial class. Focus on the feedback of the professor and use your essay as a standing point. The class is a S/NC so focus on getting easy point early  and not worrying on the final later on. 	7	6/24/2018
		might be a hard class if you are not native speaker, but professor Fenton is super nice if you go to his OH and watch his pre recorded lectures. Don't bomb your essay cause those are like 75% of your grade. At the end this is only a S/NS class.	5	3/16/2021
		This class fail you twice or more on purposely so u can take it again before you get ready for engl 004, especially ucr English department or UC trying make money from our pocket. U only get 5 tries then they automatically move you up to engl 004. Personally I would definitely not take that class again Bc it’s just waste of time, units and dragging ur own major requirements, so I would said take “city college classes” to skip bswt 003 and English 004, so u can waive out engl 1a. Used “Assist.org” to help which city college class can transfer to ucr engl 1a. In the end, don’t waste your energy this class because bswt 003 is joke and rigged asf. I wouldn’t recommend it if ppl got place this class after taking AWPE, either place to bswt 001, 002 and 003. It just waste of energy and time investment. 	9	6/17/2021
		I have Rob D' Annibale and he's kinda chill and caring enough to make sure that everyone can pass although some will fail at 1st time. 2 essays, 1 examination with essays, 1 final, and the rest are grammar quiz/workshops. He's tough grader on essays and grammars. His lectures are mostly clear, but he could make a misstep in his lectures which can affect the entire learning process. If you're struggling, go to his office hours for feedback or ARC. Overall, I wouldn't blame the professor, I blame the course for being too tough and painstaking. Just try passing the AWPE or take CC English courses to avoid falling behind in English requirement. 	9	12/7/2021
		Took it w Ballard. It honestly wasn't that hard, I just personally really struggled and hated writing essays so it stressed me out. There were two take home essays that were abt two pages long each, one in-class essay, and a final. The only downside of this class is the amount of materials you're required to buy, which is around $200 in total. The prof is fairly easy to talk to, and would point out things that was wrong in the essay that u wrote, u just gotta take the initiative to actually talk to him. Overall, and easy class since it's a S/NC.	4	4/6/2023
BUS010	4.06	Raj Singh the first of many extremely easy classes by him. Do online quizes and the extra credit assignments for an easy A.	1	3/31/2018
		I should have gotten an A, but I missed quizzes during lectures. Make sure you attend lecture for quizzes	9	12/19/2018
		Not an easy A despite what ratemyprof says. Choose your members for your group project carefully, and if there are any problems (ie them not doing work) tell your TA and she will handle it. I got low B's on both midterms and final, but I worked really hard for the business plan and got it checked by my TA twice. And got the only A given in that discussion on the business plan. 	7	12/15/2018
		They changed the format of this class so that a different professor teaches each lecture. This is kind of confusing, but you should be able to get a good grade if you go to class and study.	3	11/14/2019
		Took it in 2019 with the new professor rotation format. The midterm average was like a 53% but there was a roughly 30% curve. Easy class and lectures optional. Make sure you study from slides posted online. No homework or essays. Grade is entirely midterm, final, and discussion	4	12/13/2019
		Fall 2019. New curriculum with rotating professors, which is still adjusting. The first midterm was ridiculously hard (but there was an extremely generous curve), but the final was ridiculously easy. No mandatory attendance except for discussions. Overall the class was really easy.	3	12/17/2019
		Took in Fall 2019. They rotated out different professors every other day, so many days were not worth going to class.  Discussions important for participation and no quizzes in discussion. 1 Midterm and Final, which was very easy if you study the lecture slides the day before.	3	2/25/2020
		Very easy. Took Fall 2019 with the revamped class. Professors switch off teaching once every few days. Attendance is not mandatory; I never went to class because slides were posted online. Just attend discussion for participation points. There's no homework. Midterm is worth 35% and Final is worth 50%. Midterm was pretty hard but it was curved greatly to make the average a B-. Raw score average was like an D or F. Final was extremely easy, it didn't need to be curved. It boosted my grade from a B+ to an A-. The class might be changed again.	2	2/28/2020
		I had professor paul kirwan and he was interesting. He really goes through the whole chapter of the book in one class really quick so TRY TO COPY SLIDES DOWN BEFOREHAND. His midterms are kind of hard if you do not read or know any of the concepts. 	5	11/3/2020
		Paul Kirwan Fall2020: Zoom lectures required. He reads off the slides and that doesn’t really help. You have to find the textbook but you don’t need it imo. Chapter tests, group discussions, group project, final. 	3	11/11/2020
		took with prof Kirwan and did not attend lectures since hes literally reading everything out of the book. Read over the book chapters instead and taught myself and got A's on all of the midterms. Midterms were also open book. Only hard thing about this class is the group project since you have to create your own product or service to sell and pretend you're a business. 	4	11/30/2020
		Basically a vocab and concepts class with a group project. Read the textbook and you should be fine. Kirwan lowkey sucked as professor though.	4	12/14/2020
		I had Professor Kirwan for Fall 2020 online. Due to health and connection issues, lectures were cancelled at times and some students were unhappy about this. The only homework we had was from discussion, and there was a stressful group project. Midterms and the final are not super easy, but they are open note and manageable.	6	12/30/2020
		The lectures and discussions are mandatory but he was out sick a lot so the schedule changed constantly. Would highly recommend studying from the textbook as some of his questions are very specific that he doesn't go over in the lecture. Group project was okay, definitely regret not starting earlier and I ended up having to do most of it myself.	4	1/31/2021
		I had Intro to Business with Raj Singh, he is nice but goes on long tangents, it gets super boring. Lectures are hard to pay attention to. There are 2 midterms, 1 final (not cumulative), 6-7 homework assignments, 1 final project (+ presentation), and a couple small e-portfolio presentations. Do not let the prof’s boring lectures get in the way of you getting a good grade. Use the Cengage practice questions, do the textbook reading, and try to pay attention during lectures. For the final project, make sure to pick reliable people and refer to sample projects! Ask your TA’s to review any parts of the project you don’t understand (the rubric is confusing). If you focus and don’t treat the class as a joke, you can get a good grade. 	5	1/20/2022
		Super easy class, professor Raj gives so much extra credit and just a breeze with the open note first 2 tests. The final and project are heavy weighting but can ace everything else in the class. super easy	2	12/23/2022
BUS020	6.43	The final is so hard that it is majorly curved.	9	3/31/2017
		Took it with Ivy Zhang! At first I thought it’d be hard because I’ve heard about the previous professor but she’s completely different. It’s helpful to go to all the lectures because she explains pretty thoroughly. She also does Poll Everywhere so might as well go to class. She does online homework but you have unlimited tries, and there’s also online quizzes but the quesrions mostly online. Midterm was fairly easy, as long as you keep up with your stuff and GO TO DISCUSSION, it really helps!	4	6/4/2019
		No one has no clue what's going on in this class. Just do your homework. Lectures don't help since they are on the homework due the week before. Your TA is your best bet in learning anything. Average grade for the final was 55%	5	12/14/2019
		Samuelson is hard to keep up with sometimes. Material gets hard after the midterm. Everyone fails the final but it is curved. 	5	3/7/2020
		[COVID-19 ERA] Took this class with Naman Desai, it wasn't really too useful too be honest. The professor was passionate about his subject and really understanding towards the students during this difficult time. But in that process unfortunately students had to suffer through recorded lectures and a subpar standard of teaching. My TA (Arthur Hou) wasn't much of a help either which only added to the stress of this class. I wish this class was in-person so I could've fully understood these concepts as accounting is an extremely important and useful subject.	7	6/11/2020
		Took it during COVID. I felt that bc of how people were getting adjusted, this class just.... was not the class to take. Taking the class, it felt like it isn't something you can reliably teach online. Props to the teacher for being positive and continuing but it just felt like no communications most of the time. Definitely not recommend during online learning. 	8	9/30/2020
		I took it with Naman Desai winter 2021. Class was asynchronous with optional zoom lectures on thursday. Two exams and about 7 or so quizzes total. Not the most organized class tbh but just go over the practice problems from the recordings and you'll be good to go.	4	3/23/2021
		I took this class during winter 2021 when classes were online with Naman Desai. This is probably the worst class I have ever taken. The midterm and exam weren't too difficult. Honestly, if you just find random quizlets with accounting questions and use those to study, chances are that you'll see similar questions on his exams. The prof doesn't really teach - he just shows you how to do textbook problems without explaining anything. He assigned us weekly quizzes, but I didn't find them that useful. They only showed us what types of questions he was going to give us on the exams. He also didn't give us a practice midterm or final which I thought was inconsiderate, considering we were online and he wasn't that good of a professor. The TAs were also barely useful. They would just upload videos explaining the answers to quizzes, but those explanations weren't that good in my opinion. I think that this class was manageable, but not a good experience. 	8	3/25/2021
		Barry Mishra is a horrible professor. He steals lectures from other professors and does not care about students. Basically self teach	9	5/12/2021
		I had Mishra and he was alright. tuesdays were asynchronous lectures and thursdays were synchronous but not mandatory. the asynchronous lectures were the most helpful because the practice problems he went over were the same format as test questions. the material was pretty hard tbh but if you're willing to study and do practice questions it should be manageable. 	6	5/23/2021
		Worst class I've taken this year. This is an introductory humanities class. I took it with Bruce Samuelson spring 2022. For the final and midterm we literally had A STUDENT teach us the test information because our entire class was so lost. His entire class was horrible. During lectures he would read off slides and ramble incoherently. Despite the HUGE curve on the midterm someone received a 9.0 out of 100. 9 POINTS!!!!!! That is fucking insane. Safe to say Samuelson is a complete imbecile. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE TAKE BUS020 WITH SAMUELSON. Unless you took accounting in highschool or are a fucking aerospace engineer this course will not be fun. We also had to pay $130 to pay for textbook/hw program. Now I am down $130 and my gpa is completely tanked.	10	6/8/2022
		$150 mandatory website code to do homework, SAMUELson is hard	8	4/10/2023
BUS100W	5.38	I had Corrine Knight. 4 books needed for this class but they weren't expensive. 4 essays in total: first was easy, second was alright but a bit hard, third was hard, and fourth was easy for me. Quizzes were given randomly and sometimes in the middle of lecture, so go to class on time. Only one midterm and all questions come from quizzes so it's easy. Two presentations (one video pres.) but they're pretty simple. TAs can be a bit strict in grading essays so try to get feedback from them.	6	12/1/2018
		Be prepared to do the most for this class just to get a passing grade. The essays are very time consuming and are scrutinized by the TA's	9	12/11/2019
		"I took this Winter 2019 (i think). TAs grades based on the syllabus the professor gives but the feedback will always be ~2-3 week slate and by then you will have to start on your next essay. What the professor says to do and what the TA says tend to be different AND the TA's have to give 3 essays from each of their discussion to the professor to be graded. 
One incident where a student had an A paper but the professor graded it to a C paper because the tone of her essay wasn't professional enough but the TA said it was perfectly fine. The first midterm is really easy because it's all lecture-based but the final is a timed write and basically feels kind of like an AP Lang/Lit timed write.
There are around 4 essays total. Just don't take it with other heavy writing business courses"	8	11/12/2020
		I had it with Acker and it was an easy class for me, someone who sucks at English. There's three main assignments and a project. The textbook is also really helpful and there's a required workshop course you have to enroll in (0.5 units). Before every assignment (except the final paper), you have to go to this workshop. Overall, this class is definitely not a stress inducer. 	3	12/23/2020
		Took Bus100w online. Prof Acker is really cool and the projects are very easy. Don't really need to pay much attention in his lectures and his quizzes are moderately easy. 	3	11/12/2021
		Took class with Dr. John Acker. The lectures are mostly based on his PowerPoints, which are regularly posted to Canvas. There are 3 writing assignments that make up the final grade, but the professor gives two or three weeks to work on each one. Definitely worth attending discussion to get feedback on writing assignments ahead of time.	4	12/3/2022
BUS101	3.38	I took it with Rich Yueh. One of the best business professors you'll have imo. He's new to UCR but he knows his stuff and actually relates to us. I will admit, lectures were boring every now and then, but he had a good sense of humor that made up for it and the material was pretty easy to understand. He's really nice and accommodating, and goes the extra mile for students. Posts slides on iLearn but they're not that comprehensive, so you need to go to lecture for a more detailed understanding of the material. Five homework assignments but were super easy and quizzes given in lecture every other week, no midterm or final. No book needed for this class. Overall, a fun, easy class with a great professor.	4	3/14/2019
		Class is really easy, Professor Rich is really awesome. No book was needed because he said he knows college is expensive. Material is really easy, but if you have no coding experience the latter half of the class might be difficult for you because you have 2 assignments that require you to know Python	2	1/6/2020
		Professor Rich is probably one of the best professors UCR has to offer. The final project requires coding so if coding isn't your thing then oof. Overall, I enjoyed this class a lot and I was bummed that it had to end.	4	12/23/2020
		easy A, basic coding. 5 labs and 3 projects 	1	5/27/2022
		This class was mostly grading on coding. Where the professor has 3 project 2 of the projects were coding and the last project was a presentation. There were also labs were it was mostly coding. The first two weeks of class your going to learn Java script and the rest of the class was mostly on python. Literally by the end of the quarter the professor emailed the whole class that people were cheating on the first two project and there was a person who got caught cheating on the second project but they never cheated on anything as every other student got good grades for their codes even if they cheated. For some reason they think the professor sees their code and compares it to everyone else and just says that they’re cheating when they’re literally knowing what it’s code does and how it works and still ended up getting written up to the academic integrity department where everyone else is free. And this was like one of those public sights to deal with python codes where the public can see your codes and you can’t do anything about unless you pay for it’s services to make your code private. Once you meet with the integrity office person and said what you did and how it came to this then once they meet with your professor they’ll say the opposite of what you said and what you did wrong then your getting the blame for cheating. If you’re going to take this class just be careful about your codes and hope there isn’t any relations to other students code or else you’ll probably get an email saying you’ve cheated an assignment.  Also if you’ve got written up for academic dishonesty for some reason after your case has been dealt with, you’re not able to email the professor and saying that they’ll change your grade for us and would say that who ever is the person you’ve been dealing with the case their just going to say the professor has to change the grade for you and you’ll won’t know how to be in contact with the professor because they’ll just ignore the email about this. This class shouldn’t be too difficult unless you know how to do code but they gave it a 10 due to this experience being that they know how to code and everything for some reason the professor just accused them for cheating when they weren’t. Students shouldn’t go to UCR because most facilities are just finding new ways to get money and when you realized during the orientation it was mostly that the school wanted more money and that’s why the school accepted more students due because once there were more students equals more money to the school it really sounds like this is a corrupted system. 	10	8/26/2022
		Took class with Prof Rich Yueh. Lectures are not mandatory, but worth attending if you’re interested/concentrating in Information Systems as they provide useful information. The projects are mostly Python programming, with the final being an app prototype. The difficulty of projects will depend on your knowledge of programming logic, but can definitely be accomplished if you go to office hours for help when needed. Overall, a good class to take. 	3	12/3/2022
BUS102	6.33	"It's hard to rate this classes difficulty since it was entirely artificially difficult. The professor, Sean Jasso, caps all of the grades on any assignment at a high B or a very low A, essentially ensuring that you will receive a B or B- in the class. If you want to receive anything higher than a B or B-, you'll have to go to office hours and do a little brown nosing of the T.A and the professor, as well as do any ""value added"" activities that he assigns in the class. When you do the writing assignments make sure that you write each one out to the maximum length. I.E, if he tells you to write 3 pages, write to the very bottom of page 3, no more, no less."	6	12/20/2018
		The other answer on this explains it pretty well already - Professor Jasso caps the assignments at a B+/A- for some reason. The worst part of the class is that it's at 7:30 AM, so he knows that a lot of people aren't going to attend lecture. Honestly, he's a cool dude and pretty funny at times, but he can be THAT professor that takes attendance when he sees that people aren't showing up. There are weekly reading assignments that you have to write in 10 pt font single space. You get used to it and it really doesn't seem that bad when writing - the reading part is what takes a lot. In the syllabus there's a format for all the readings, so make sure you answer the questions, using the key words of the format. The TAs are going to receive hundreds of 3 pages of 10 pt font single space assignments, they're not going to read it word for word. For the midterms (2 separate days of 2 questions out of 4, so one day one question, the other day another), Jasso is going to choose it by random. He crumbles up papers with the question numbers on them, makes students switch it around, and reveals it in front of the class. With all this entertainment, the midterm and the final (that's during week 10, but choosing 2 out of 5 questions) only allow for 30 minutes of writing time. On the exams, he does say to reference lecture for some of them. It's hard to go to this class with it being so early in the morning, but hopefully you all have the drive to do it. If you do end up not going to class, try your best for the ones before the midterms and finals. He might talk about it. If this is one of the first core classes you take, brace yourself for another Jasso class with the same format (BUS103).	5	12/14/2019
BUS103	6.00	Lectures are a waste of time, but go after the 1st midterm they take attendance. When doing your reading notes do it in this format: summary, pro/con analysis, sprinkle in a few buzzwords from the book that Jasso hasn't reviewed yet, throw in a personal reference in your life that is a real world example, and then conclude it with how you could use the concept in your future life. 	7	6/18/2018
		Reading Notes are a pain. Get started on your marketing plan early. Tests aren’t too bad	5	3/23/2019
		Took online with Nik Terhani. Great Professor! Have to do discussion papers weekly on what we learned that week and then do open note quizzes. His midterm was open notes as well and we have a group project at the end of the quarter. TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN!! 	5	11/12/2021
BUS104	5.86	I took it with Kamvar Farahbod. This class isn't too hard to be honest. Homework usually had 4 to 7 questions and lectures were super boring because he reads off the slides. The slides are posted on iLearn but aren't always easy to understand imo, so I highly recommend buying the book because it teaches you the material better than he does. Doesn't always take attendance but might do so if he feels that less people come to lectures. Quizzes are given in discussion every week, so definitely attend. One midterm and one final; midterm had 35 questions (i think) on chapters 1-4 and final is on last four chapters. Overall, an okay class and you'll likely get a B or an A.	6	3/14/2019
		All the learning comes from the discussion. Heavy curve in the midterm and final	8	3/23/2019
		Professor is super boring but the homework and tests are not that bad.	5	5/29/2019
		I took it with Mohsen El-Hafsi. Class was a mess lol. He only gave two attempts on the webassign homeworks which was quite frustrating. Study the midterm review and final review and discussion problems those are extremely HELPFUL. 	7	3/22/2022
		Decision Analysis with Prof El-Hafsi. Webassign homework assignments every 2 weeks, and 1 midterm + 1 final (not cumulative). No recorded lectures and mandatory disc attendance. The content became progressively harder as the quarter went, around week 8 the homework became very difficult. Do not procrastinate hw, it takes time. Pay attention and take notes on how to use solver. It can be a difficult class but if you do practice questions and keep up with lectures you will be fine. TA’s were mostly unhelpful. Take notes, practice, learn how to use solver and you’re good to go. Don’t forget to study conceptual content for the exams. (Exams were all multiple choice, in person.)	7	3/8/2023
BUS105	5.75	I had Prof. Turcic and watching lecture and looking over the slides is a must. This course is new content for most people so set aside extra time to digest the info. However, once you understand it it is actually pretty easy concepts to grasp. He also lets you take your homework and exams with unlimited attempts, but you don't get your score until the deadline passes. 	5	12/23/2020
		Took with Adem Orsdemir W21, fully asynchronous - 20-40min each lecture, released during official class time sharp, attendance taken via simple quizzes on lecture material. He teaches materials well, but it would definitely help if you have an interest in it beforehand and you need to get used to his accent. Very understanding, allowed midterm retake and drops lowest homework.	6	2/23/2021
		Production and Operation with Gurumurthi. His syllabus says no midterm, but he gives one anyway. 1 Midterm, 1 cumulative final, some easy hw assignments, in-class quizzes, and 1 group simulation. Nice guy, he can get in your face if you aren’t paying attention in class. Go to lecture, he randomly takes attendance and assigns in-class quizzes (he usually tells you the answers in class). Not a difficult class, take good notes because his exams are usually online, open book/note. Make sure to create all the spreadsheets with him, you can plug numbers in later to solve questions on the midterm/final. 	6	3/8/2023
BUS106	6.20	I took it with Professor Peter Chung. Easily the worst professor I have ever had. He is so hard to understand and is an extremely harsh grader. If you do bad on the first midterm, the best grade you can get in the class is a C. 	10	10/13/2020
		This class was not hard at all, as long as you understand the formulas and you'll be fine. 	5	11/16/2020
		Forget what the person above said about the professor. The class is pretty doable and I got an A. Just know how to use the formulas and the concepts behind the math problems and you'll be good. 	5	12/13/2020
		Took the course Fall 2020. It was online. Professor Chung was very accessible and the TAs put in an impressive amount of work. The course was difficult in that the material can be foreign and the conceptual questions in exams really test your knowledge of the material. 3 exams (2 MT, 1 final), noncumulative. Homework was very doable. 	6	12/28/2020
BUS152	1.00	easy A . Professor Malousak Seyednematollah exam and slide exactly the same, so as long as you review the slide you'll be fine.  four case analysis, 1 midterm ,1 final, 1 group project	1	12/7/2022
		Took it online with Dr. Damian Dunbar in Spring 2021. The class is really not that difficult if you do the extra practice problems and skim through the textbook to gain a better understanding of the concepts. Do well on the homework and the extra practice quizzes because some of the questions are the same as the exam questions with only a few numbers switched around. Would also recommend doing the textbook problems for more practice. 	5	6/15/2021
BUS107	7.50	Took it with Kyle Ingram. I feel like the professor made this class harder than it needed to be tbh. Weekly readings assigned but they weren't too long. 4 randomly assigned quizzes in total, but the fourth quiz was basically showing up to the case competition presentation for credit. Quizzes were multiple choice and short answer, but were hard because the TAs were harsh graders. In fact, there was some grading discrepancy since one TA graded easier than other TAs. The prof. posts lectures on iLearn but you should still go anyway. One group project presentation and term paper assigned too. Discussion was useless imo but go for attendance. You don't need the textbook for this class but buy it if you don't understand the class material. Overall, not easy to get an A in this class. 	7	12/16/2018
		Professor Ingram is no longer teaching the course but he gave 4 random quizzes worth 10% of the overall grade each. They are pretty difficult because he does not say when they are going to be and what they are about. So always review before lecture! The last quiz was free because you just vote on the group presentations. The group project is not that bad but it depends on how motivated your group members are. Make friends with your TA because they grade your term paper.	8	5/29/2019
BUS108	5.00	You need to buy a new book for the online code. 	2	12/15/2018
		Wasn't too wild but professor Woody Liao is extremely difficult to understand. Unfortunately he isn't great with technology either. A lot of self-learning was done in that class. 	8	3/22/2021
BUS109	5.00	Took with Raveendran online Spring 2021. Super easy course, some busy work but insanely doable. Consider her as your professor as opposed to Jasso or Weigel if you don't like suffering	5	6/7/2021
BUS110	3.00	Took with Md, insanely easy course. Had a group project, 4 labs that included excel, tableau, and Azure, 2 writing assignments (super easy), and midterm + final. The only way to fail this course is to literally not do your work. 	3	6/7/2021
BUS112	7.00	Took with Thomas Karmer for fall2022. only 1 midterm and 1final (40% & 60%) so if you are not a good tester then you gonna failed.	7	12/7/2022
BUS114	4.00	if you have this class with jonathan lim, it is very easy. all you need to do is know the weekly content, fill out a google form answering questions on the content of that week and 3-4 group work that is based off if what is taught in class. no exams at all. he does grade a little hard on the group work but if you try you will be good 	4	1/11/2023
BUS121	2.00	This class is a very easy A! I would highly recommend taking this class if it is professor Raj Singh. All of the questions are online and the projects are fairly easy. I would not worry too much about this class since it is fairly easy. 	2	6/7/2022
BUS124	8.00	Midterm one, average was 60% and the final was about 55%. Final and midterms are 60% of your grade. 20% of hw, which is super easy. 20% group project for research presentation. Overall, class was hard. It wasn't hard for me since I have the analytic computer science background but for your average business student, it can be hard. 	8	12/14/2019
BUS125	7.50	"Material was complex, and the professor's lectures made it even harder.
The class was mostly excell based so you really only had to memorize how to model everything, but I had a hard time understanding the concepts behind the mechanics of building the models.
Like why does one problem use binomial inverse instead of normal inverse. 
I would have appreciate it a little more review into calculus before the class got into full swing, but I understand that the winter quarter is scheduled tight especially for Mon/Wed classes"	8	3/22/2021
		[COVID-19] Took it with Long Gao. Definitely not fit to write a proper comment because I chose to not participate in the class anymore lol. This is an all Excel class and it teaches you how to use it in realistic situations with businesses. It's a pretty challenging class - almost all of the homework is about 1 to 3 problems, and you have to apply what you learned in lecture to these problems. On the first day you'll be able to assign yourself to a group on a spreadsheet - there will be two group presentations every lecture to go over the homework problems. The professor walks you through the logic of the homework problems but you'll have to set up Excel yourself. He gives you a template in PDF form so you can't copy and paste it onto Excel, but you have an idea of what you have to do. The first midterm is one question that was similar to the homework question. That's all I can say for the class cause the rest I didn't even try, sorry. Seems like a pretty useful class. 	7	3/22/2021
BUS126	7.00	Highly recommend that you take this class AFTER having at least completed BUS 104 and BUS 105. (I was unaware of this and took it as a junior for my first quarter at UCR - it was brutal)	7	11/29/2018
BUS127	4.00	"Dr. Linda Penas is very nice and a pretty good instructor, though she has a tendency to just read off of her slides. For Spring 2020 (everything online), she only uploaded lecture slides that had material that would be on the exams (1 midterm, 1 final). There is also a weekly lab using Minitab 19, and it is really easy. The material is mostly just different procedures/concepts of statistics used in business and manufacturing situations to determine quality of products/processes. Equations are WAY easier than in most statistics classes and you are allowed to make a ""cheat sheet"" for exams so you don't really have to memorize any. DEFINITELY useful for Business majors; a bit less useful for Statistics majors/minors in terms of material we will use someday, but it's good for seeing how to apply statistics in real life. "	4	5/15/2020
BUS132	8.00			
BUS136	5.00	The content of the class itself is not that hard, but for me the professor sucked. I took the class with Jean Helwege in F21. She tends to go off topic, so you don't really know what is most important. For exams, she asks questions about things that were barely mentioned in class, like the name of some obscure person. The paper she assigned for the end of the quarter was the most difficult. She didn't give us proper instructions and just expected us to know what to do based off a complicated example. She also graded us relative to other groups in the class, so in a way it wasn't fairly graded.	5	1/27/2022
BUS143	3.50	[COVID-19] I took this class with Ye Li and it was honestly a really good class. At first, it was annoying that he sends out about 5 emails reminding you to do the web assignment before the first lecture (basically a ~15 minute survey for every class that relates to the lesson - he collects the students' stats to present in class). The professor is pretty lenient with the web assignments being submitted a little bit late, but that's not the case for the write ups. In the class besides the web assignments, there are 5 write-ups (with assigned readings ranging from like 5 to 15 pages, a big one being 30ish) in total that you need to do out of 8 offered in 10 weeks. The first two write ups (counted as 1) is with a randomly assigned group and was 600 words each. The rest, you are free to chose as long as you have done 5. There's no midterm and only a final - the final you have the option to go solo or choose a partner/have the professor choose one for you. The final is about a case study with 6 questions and all he tells you is that you have to use class concepts for it. You have 5 days to complete it and it had a word limit of 2000. The professor is great, he makes every topic interesting and has a lot of opportunities for extra credit throughout the quarter. Should basically be a pretty easy A class as long as you make the effort to do the web assignments and write ups. They're due every Thursday but if you turn it in the Sunday before, you get an extra credit point added to your score. I'd really recommend this class as an elective! My concentration is IS and this was definitely one of the easier classes I've taken and it was genuinely a good class. 	4	3/22/2021
		Professor Ye is amazing and the class is really interesting. Your grade is based on 4 write-ups (you can pick from out of 8 topics), participation, and a final. The class isn't hard at all if you spend time doing the readings and listen in class.	3	3/26/2021
BUS145	4.00	Fairly easy. Quizzes are online, two page essays every week, 15 page research paper within a group. Just must attend class because activities are like 20% of grade. Overall, the work is easy just requires a bit of work. 	4	12/14/2019
BUS146	3.00	"This class with Haibo Liu is a really fun class about entrepreneurship. It mainly consist of a midterm presentation, a final presentation, a take home final, and participation credit. Doing the bare minimum and showing interest can get you a good grade in this class.
"	3	5/24/2021
BUS149	2.50	Took this class with Maciejovsky. Probably the most interesting material in any business course and would highly recommend attending lectures. A Couple 600 word essays that are fairly easy. No final except for a group presentation at the end. Easy weekly hw assignments that take <5 mins. Highly recommend. 	3	2/15/2022
BUS154	6.00	Took it with Alcaraz, not really hard, just beyond annoying that 30% of your grade is a group project and presentation in a pandemic. the prof also has attendance and participation as about 25% of the grade, and he’s never clear as to how those are calculated considering he said attendance wasn’t mandatory at the beginning of the quarter	6	12/28/2020
BUS155	6.00	Fall 2020 (online b/c Covid); Raj Sign taught this. If you have Raj as a professor (like in 107) then you will know the format. You will have a group project that is due at the end of the lecture week. The course materials itself aren't really hard and all of what he teaches are on the lecture slide. You can buy the book but tbh I'm not sure it's beneficial to learning. If you are a person who needs the book copy, just buy a pdf of it (usu. around $20 if you know where to look or maybe even free). You have 2 quizzes that are unannounced and will tell you about them when the time comes. There are 2 exams (open-book)and 1 final. There is HW and it's better if you do them as you finish the chapters. The HW is due at the end of the week 10	6	12/16/2020

BUS165A	9.00	"Had Prof Ke Li (Fall 2018). This is one of those ""weeder"" classes. If you truly want to pursue accounting, this class requires you to attend EVERY SINGLE LECTURE. The book is not required, you just need to purchase an access code for BUS 165 series, this code will be used for the entire series (A-C). Attendance is mandated and points are deducted for every lecture missed. There's a total of 20 points, miss 10 lectures, you receive no participation points when calculating grades. The course is challenging, yes, however, study well and try to achieve the highest possible score possible on each assignment (homework, pre-lecture quizzes, tests, etc.). You will need to keep track of the assignments due after and before each week as he does not remind you, and it's a lot of assignments if you don't keep up. The class is graded based upon the weighted grade or total points achieved, whichever one is higher. This is a class where if you don't put in work, you will fail, even if the professor says ""85% of the class will get a B- or higher"". Exams will have questions from the CPA exam. Overall, if you think accounting upper divs is an easy A, this major/concentration is not for you. "	9	1/29/2019
BUS165B	5.00			
BUS168A	6.00	Winter 2022 Class was doable, easier compared to 168B, took it with Eric Allen, tests were free response so there are a lot of possible partial credit points, grade consisted of 2 exams, discussion during lecture (you're assigned a day and you're expected to contribute to the discussion on that specific day), and the end of the quarter group project where you guys complete a 1040 together with little to no help 	6	11/2/2022
BUS168B	8.00	Spring 2022 Was significantly harder than 168A in my opinion; 2 exams online, homework online, end of the term project - had to fill out tax return (if i remember correctly it was either for a partnership or corporation, you get to choose) - Pittard is a good lecturer but the topic in general is just difficult 	8	11/2/2022
BUS171	5.00	Took class Fall 2020. Class was online. Kan was a great guy. We had 1 final and 1 midterm, noncumulative. Homework assignments were very reasonable. He recorded all lectures and only required 2-3 in Zoom sessions whereas the rest of the course was done asynchronously. 	5	12/28/2020
BUS173	6.00	[COVID-19] Had Kan Wang after taking 171 last quarter with him as well. Pretty easy class and it has been in the same format for both. The class is mainly asynchronous with 2 live sessions - one on the first day and another around week 3. One midterm and one final (noncumulative) with most questions from the textbook and a few made by him based on the homework. There are about 4 homework assignments spread out evenly, so make sure to start a little earlier. He has extended one homework before due to some students being unable to install Microsoft Office software properly, but be reasonable and don't start the day before it's due and ask for an extension lol. Two out of four were using Microsoft Access. The last homework is always a small research paper where you have to explain a concept (for this class it was the difference between relational databases and NoSQL). Pretty easy class if you just do the work.	4	3/22/2021
		5 quizzes worth 30% of grade, 1 midterm 30%, 1 group project 30%, and participation 10% the class is hard if you don't know SQL and you will have to put in your own effort to do well because a lot of the work is not mandatory but just recommended 	8	10/25/2022
BUS174	3.00	only a few homework assignments, midterm, and group project. relatively easy and a chill info systems class	3	10/25/2022
BUS175	1.00	Took with Underhill, insanely easy professor that accomodates and understands his students. Just do the work, most of it is guided and not hard at all. The only reason you fail this course at all is because you decided to do all your work the day it was due (all our work was due last day of week 10 btw).	1	6/7/2021
BUS179	2.00	Amazing professor. He is quite young so he relates to his students a lot. Very easy weekly labs because all of them have a step-by-step guide on how to complete it. Offers good insight and is very kind/caring. 	1	3/22/2021
		Rich Yueh is an amazing teacher to have. Class grading structure was easy and the ARCGIS platform was interesting to learn. Majority of the class is based on labs and application of labs in Projects.	3	3/25/2021
CAH001	1.00	extremely easy class, homework takes on average a couple seconds to a couple minutes. introductory class about the cahuilla people and language. highly recommend for breadth requirements 	1	2/13/2023
CBNS101	6.33	Bachant is a terrific prof.  He provides all you need to know in his slides and supplementals.  The final was harder than the material from the first two midterms though.  Don't expect a huge curve since averages on midterms were 77-80%.	6	12/17/2018
		Took it with Bachant. Cool dude, but its a hard class. He gave us supplementals for the lectures and they are REALLY useful. Tests seem impossible at first, but they make sense as you read it a couple of times more.	8	12/28/2020
		This class is very interesting. Santhakumar was a great professor. She gives practice exams, clarifying slides, etc. She also gave a huge curve at the end of the course, so it is not hard to get a high grade in this class.	7	4/2/2021
		Zur nieden and Karginov: class was split in half and the first half was very difficult. We just had a quiz and a midterm (create your own study guide). Quizzes were very difficult with zur nieden. Study guide was graded based on comparison, not how you study, which defeats the purpose of the study guide. The 2nd half was much easier. Brought my grade back up. 	7	12/13/2021
		Zur Nieden is great. Had the study guide midterm assignment and thought it was an easy A. Quizzes were okay but easier when studying with friends.	3	1/3/2022
		Vijayalakshmi Santhakumar taught this class very well. She did a hybrid of online and in-person for those who couldn’t come into class. Her tests were online and open-note. I would suggest really studying for this class ahead of time to understand the concepts and the material, such as re-watching the lectures she posts. She also posts a lot of additional information to help you understand the material. She was always available during office hours as well. 	7	3/18/2022
CBNS106	6.67	No homework, but there is a lot of material to go over, especially post midterm. Make sure you are on top of all the material, because it’s honestly a bit too much to cram right before the exam. Class is was really interesting though!	7	12/10/2019
		Very interesting class; study regularly and it will be easy to do well	6	8/20/2020
		"First half I had Dr.Anderson, very straightforward guy. Even when he ""tries"" to trick you, its not difficult at all. Just lots of material as any upper div bio class. His average was around 67
Second half was with Dr. Hongdian. He has a rep for teaching the more dense/confusing stuff, but its not that bad at all. Just go to class so you can understand what the diagrams mean - its really straightforward if you attend his lecture and  listen/write what he says.
The discussion section requires a brain anatomy practicum so study hard for that one. "	7	8/27/2020
		Class is not hard and exams are open note; there is a small curve ; highly recommend taking it in the summer	5	12/29/2020
		Online exams were no back-tracking, but it wasn't bad. Very straightforward questions, and Dr. Fiacco had lecture outlines that were really helpful when studying. Really enjoyed this class overall! :)	7	12/31/2020
		Took it in Fall 2021, 97% of your grade is midterm and final, 6% discussion. Final is not cumulative but the exams are tricky. Understand the material well enough to answer tricky mc questions. 	8	1/3/2022
CBNS116	8.00	3 exams. not cumulative. I took it with professor Dr.Fiacco and he was incredible! Provides lecture notes himself. Study those for the test AND study the pictures of brain slices presented in class if he talks about those regions in his notes. tbh lots of material but if yeah neuro nerds this class is for you	8	8/27/2020
		Had it with Daddy Fiacco. Study often and when you do actually write out the terminology/area/function because it helps with fill in the blank exams/quizzes. GL. 	8	6/9/2022
CBNS120	9.00	"For Michael Adams, JUST AVOID HIM AT ALL COST. Class averages were always around 50%. If you are not a NURO major, I would not even take this class AT ALL. Studying is super difficult for his class because his slides are blank and refers to outside articles.

For Cho, he is a great professor for this class and only teaches the most important things in NURO. I would take him, again, if you are a NURO major and need this course."	10	2/24/2019
		"Hybrid Class
Powerpoint: Almost all pictures. Think of it as TED talk style presentation where you focus on the person instead of the presentation, unless he refers to it.

Professor's ability to engage: 3.5 since he talks slow and takes pauses from 5-10 sec to an occasional 30 sec. Reading the content on your own is more amusing than focusing on his words. For those who like structured lectures... you better make your own structure because this professor is like your grandparents where they tell you a narrative and somehow, we get too deep into one idea that is not relevant to the exams. Overall, it's disorganized learning.

Contents in exams/quizzes: Based on another student who only listened to lectures, he has a >90% on Midterm; another one who focused more on the notes has around 80-90%. Open note. Half/half context or terminology, the other is calculation and reading graphs/charts

TAs: they're straight-forward and their content is more informative.

Tips for survival:
-When studying for this course, organize your notes by the following: 
1.) what/how/why of each article he's discussing
2.) Terminology and the general concepts of a specific structure
3.) Formulas and graphs/charts that he's referencing about.
4.) Actually practice math, because this man barely reviews about it and it's 1/4 on the Midterm

Avoid if:
1.) Planning on missing lectures
2.) Lacking in auditory learning 
3.) Cannot tolerate monotoned voice or long pauses

Opinion: As a student with ADHD and currently on meds at its peak while taking his lecture, I was very surprised he was able to disengage my interest in paying attention to class. This class is narrative based and contains a lot of reading without clear guidance on what to actually study. If you find yourself getting frustrated with him, just remember that he's willing to teach you if you ask and that he's just a human being with feelings."	8	2/10/2022
CBNS120L	5.50	Michael Adams; Lab reports are graded by TAs and it was fairly easy. As long as you answer the questions on the lab manual and explain the figures, you should be fine. Adams is very lenient when it comes to extensions. He extended all of the lab reports with no questions, just ask! Nice man, but very monotoned. 	6	6/21/2021
		Took with Peter Hickmott. Love him! Lab reports were heavy (20-30 pages) and graded harshly by TAs but there was a big curve. Also allowed extensions, but I recommend always doing reports ahead of time.	5	1/3/2022
CBNS121	4.00	Took this class with Martin Riccomango and he has a very heavy accent. It’s hard to understand him at times, but his exams correlates with his lectures. Tests in person were difficult, but manageable if you watch lectures/attend meetings. 	5	12/13/2021
		Dr. Riccomagno was amazing for this course. His tests are based off his slides. Slides are more filled with images rather than words, but they were fairly easy to understand. I really enjoyed this class a lot.	3	1/27/2022
CBNS124	7.67	Studying at least once a day three times a week helped.	7	12/15/2018
		With professor Curras during covid. She is horrible. Does not teach in zoom, instead, she posts a lot of lectures that actually have a due date, so you have to watch it before the deadline otherwise it closes. She requires both yuja and a lockdown browser. She does not make accommodations 	10	7/31/2021
		Had Curass (Fall '21) and liked her. The posted lectures had a recommended due date only for time management purposes but you can still watch it after. 2 midterms and a final. I did rough on the first midterm and final but still got an A with the curve. 	6	1/3/2022
CBNS125	8.00	Took this Fall '21 with Garret Anderson. Nice professor but difficult exams. (It was my first in person course since the pandemic).  There is mcq, frq and a matching with drugs and their mechanisms of action. VERY interesting course but required a lot more studying than other CBNS upper divs imo. Course is basically 2 exams + discussion presentation on a drug.		
		Took it with Dr. Hickmott and his tests were pretty difficult. You had to know everything. His TA Sarah was terrible. She's very strict and grades harshly on presentations. 	8	1/27/2022
CBNS128	5.00	Took it over the summer with Professor Kurt Spurgin and it was pretty easy going. Questions are straight from notes/slides. Dont need a book and no discussion so that was great. Lots of info but memorizing is enough for this course, averages for his were around 70-75 so pretty high	5	8/27/2020
CBNS150	10.00	A+ lecturer, but the multiple choice on the exams will leave you praying to any and all gods you can think of.	10	6/17/2019
		2 MT's that aren't cumulative and a final that is. 7 quizzes in discussion and you present a research article in either weeks 8,9,10. First half will be easy, but the second half the information becomes a lot more difficult. MT2 was extremely difficult. 	10	5/26/2020
CEE010	1.00	VERY easy class. Just write essays 	1	12/18/2017
		Just listen to special guests. There's 4 very short essays to write, and by short, I mean like a little over half a page. No exams or other assignments but attendance is mandatory.	1	5/9/2019
		Just had to listen to guest lecturers once per week, only 4 one page essay assignments	1	12/18/2019
CEE135	6.00	Concepts are fairly easy to understand. Took with professor Yan. Just review the slides every so often. Beware of the final paper and presentation and try to work on it asap, pick a topic not too complex or that at least one group member understands well. The final was very unexpectedly strange. The midterm was very fair. 	6	1/20/2020
CEE158	2.00	Easy class but make sure to take good notes because quizzes are open note and very specific.	2	6/14/2019
CHE100	6.33	I had Dr. Ivey. Weekly homework, sometimes there are quizzes in discussion. Cheat sheet allowed on exams, midterm wasn't particularly hard. Based off her CHE110A, I assume the final won't be any harder either. Material covered: Real/ideal gas states, energy balance, engines, entropy, steam tables. Some of the HW assignments take forever to do and she was inconsistent with the points allotted for each assignment. Overall, okay class if you know how ideal and real gases work and understand engines well.	6	3/12/2020
		Dr. Ivey is a very fair professor. Review the homeworks and her slides before the exams and you'll be fine. Thermodynamics is a pretty wack class but just trust that it'll be okay	4	5/17/2020
		Took with Bryan Wong. 2 Exams worth 45% each. HW is 10%. You can take 1 sheet of paper as a cheat sheet with anything on it (typed, written, painted, etc...). Midterm exam was based on the homework. Final was cumulative but not difficult, easier than the midterm. Most people finished well before the time limit. Curves the class so that its a standard distribution. If you get >80% on both exams and do your hw, you're likely to get an A.	4	3/25/2022
CHE105	4.00	Took with Professor Kandis Leslie Abdul-Aziz. Shes a very sweet and understanding professor. There were simple quizzes once a week to make sure you keep up with the content, there was an extremely fair midterm, and the report and presentations were very straightforward. Nothing tricky. Her notes are also very easy to follow. Overall a great class.	4	3/31/2021
CHE110A	4.00			
CHE110B	8.00	Had Nosang Myung. Lecture was hard to follow so I mostly learned through the textbook. Suggested problems (no homework) were difficult. If you can do those, you can pass the midterm. Know how to read your graphs (they get real weird looking). This course is big on balances (mass and energy). The material also overlaps with CHE100 a bit so I would suggest taking that cocurrently.	9	3/12/2020
CHE114	7.00	Fundamental course for ChE and EvnE. Calculus heavy.  	8	9/23/2018
		If you get on the professor Min's good side you will be fine. Asking for help makes this class 200% easier. She will curve the tests if people do really bad and give second chances if you mess up, or at least if enough people have an issue with failing lol	6	1/27/2022
CHE116	7.00			
CHE120	8.33	Calculus heavy. 	8	9/23/2018
		Clark is super difficult and incredibly rude. Does not accept late work whatsoever and purposefully makes the tests very difficult (he even told us this in class), doesn't curve. Exams are open book/note. Expect to see topics that weren't covered on the exams. Expect to spend several hours per question on the hw assignments.	9	2/27/2022
		Took with Dr. Clark. While the class was difficult, I think he was a good teacher and his lectures were easier to follow than some of my other ChE professors. He was not rude, despite the general consensus amongst the class, but he did have some strange rules, like no tolerance for iPad submissions. I don't think he will be teaching this course again, but in mass transfer generally expect to spend a significant amount of time on homework problems (taken from textbook). Most exam prep involved redoing homework problems, it is worth spending time on the homework to do well in the class. The problems will click after redoing them repeatedly. 	8	3/16/2022
CHE122	8.00			
CHE130	6.00	For Dr. Wu, exams are open note. Abuse the hell out of that for an easy A	3	6/14/2019
CHE135	4.00	Group Project is pretty hard, since it's a research paper on a material and the rubric doesn't do a great job of telling you what kind of information to include. The class is pretty easy and honestly interesting if you are half interested in material science as a chem/env e. 	4	1/27/2022
CHE160A	4.00			
CHEM001A	5.80	Very general chemistry, just know your stuff	4	3/29/2017
		Had Professor Harman.  Easy as long as you read the book and practice homework problems.  Know the math.	6	3/30/2017
		Easy class, but Harman gives hard tests just for the curve, so be prepared to do a lot of math and very little conceptual stuff.	4	12/10/2017
		This class is basically dumbed down AP chem which I took and got a 5 and didn't get credit for because the AP credit system is broken. Hybridization is not taught well. 	3	12/18/2017
		Hill is hard. Try to rack up points on the quizzes and just practice alot for the midterms and final. 	8	12/19/2017
		Eichler is a funny professor and easy to keep up with. Beware of his second midterm. It screws a lot of people	4	1/3/2018
		Had Professor Chang, accent makes it hard to understand but the material was relatively easy. 3 midterms and final.	4	11/18/2018
		Had Bartels. He's a pretty hard teacher but class is still doable if you study hard enough. Go to lectures and pay attention to discussion and clicker questions, they pop up on midterms and finals	7	11/21/2018
		Dr. Harman: Midterms were very easy, very much like the questions in the back of the book and Smartwork (online homework questions). Final had some curveball questions (~5 small detail questions) 	3	12/12/2018
		If you passed the AP Chemistry Test in high school, this class will be a good review for you since it will cover topics from the different models of atoms, types of bonding, intermolecular forces, and stoichiometry. (You should still cover the material so you have a good foundation and an easy time in the class though) If possible, I would recommend taking it with Fokwa. Has a thick accent but sets up the class in a way that makes it super difficult to fail (you seriously need to not do anything to not get points). He has a redemption system so you can get points back if your final exam grade is much higher than your midterm exam scores. All of his exams have extra credit problems that he will give you to do before the exam day (yay!), but he has no curve. So scores on the exams depend entirely up to you. Homework is an easy 100% as long as you do it before the deadline and gives you unlimited attempts and no score penalties (unlike other professors that I have known). 	4	12/14/2018
		It was Ludwig Bartel who was difficult. It was not your ordinary chem1A class. The average score on the midterm was a 52%. We didn't even find moles or anything, we were going over nuclear chemistry on the second day of lecture lol. The class is okay though once you study and try. Apparently he was on academic probation before this year for failing so many students, sooooooo yeah. If you do get this professor, good luck and just try. I ended up with an A, since he makes a 900/1000 an A. Yep. Good luckkkk. 	8	12/17/2018
		Had Professor Harman for this class. His class is graded on a curve where the top 15-20% get an A at the end of the quarter, which was pretty doable. Class was pretty easy and the midterm and final weren’t that bad. Second midterm was definitely harder than the first though, with the final being harder than both. If you study the problems in the book and homework, you’ll do well!	4	12/18/2018
		Had L. Bartels. His tests were all free-response with no multiple choice, and were mostly conceptual and drawing based. Fairly difficult, you would need to study a decent amount to get an A.	6	12/21/2018
		Professor was always aggro. Tests were tricky. 	9	3/23/2019
		I had Professor Lavallo and he was, well, interesting? He has a slightly condescending attitude which could be very offputting/intimidating for a student  who wants additional help or ask extra questions. His midterm was a bit difficult, the final was unexpectedly difficult, but he gave the class a MASSIVE curve and even curved the final grade; aside from the curve, the saving grace for me was that I had a a really good T.A. though I know plenty others who weren't as lucky. He was ok, not terrible (though many others would say he was), but if you have the option to avoid him, I would. But if you do end up with him, it's not really a big deal, just try to adjust around his personality, I guess. He's also extremely conceptual, and his exams heavily reflect that  (hence, the difficulty), so you have to make sure you 110% understand concepts and how to apply that. If you only understand the concepts on a surface level, you won't do so hot on the tests. Also, homework is optional and not graded, so really try to understand literally everything on it if you want to ace the exams.	7	3/23/2019
		If you took honors chem in high school it's exactly like that. Covers lewis structures, bonds, intermolecular forces, stoichiometry. Took with Fokwa. Midterms are EXACTLY like practice problems, so do those and review the notes and you're good for the midterms. The final.... hardest exam ever lol... the exam was nothing like the practice final exam he put out and he even emailed us saying that it was mistakenly harder so he gave us only 15pts extra and NO curve for the class or the exams :/. He isn't a good chem teacher, but if you can learn on your own then take his class because I taught myself 1A during summer and pulled a B. 	6	8/27/2019
		Professor Fowka had reasonable exams and a curve if you do well on the final	5	11/12/2019
		I had Bartels (AVOID IF POSSIBLE), he focuses on concepts over calculations and he ends up covering material that's not supposed to be covered until later on. He teaches super fast and with an accent, so it's hard to understand sometimes. If you haven't taken AP Chemistry or a Chemistry class at all in high school, this class is one of the worst ways to get into chemistry. 	8	11/8/2019
		I had Chang and from what I heard and seen of other professors' exams, our midterms were very easy and shorter and all multiple choice, but the final was harder and longer than midterms. Just make sure you understand all the concepts and calculations,(which are mostly simple) and you should be fine. She has clicker questions so you should attend class.	3	12/15/2019
		Took it w Bartels. AVOID bartels if possible. The course is out of a thousand points and everything is weighed equally. All assignments and tests are assessing a conceptual knowledge of chemistry, so very few calculations. He prefers many drawings and explanations. Lecture and discussion are both mandatory bc of daily clickers. There's also hw almost every day, but he only grades 40 of the hw assignments, the rest are dropped. Form study groups early bc discussions seemed to help my LC. I hated this class with a passion. Tests are difficult, especially when you aren't told what you missed points for. STUDY the practice tests that he posts and any test from him that you can get your hands on bc he likes to recycle questions. We had this one question that was on both midterms and the final. There's also two midterms, but he only takes the higher grade. gl if you get stuck w bartels	9	12/17/2019
		Avoid Bartels !!!!	7	12/17/2019
		Chang had a difficult accent to understand.	4	12/17/2019
		Took it with Dr. Hill. Avoid him if you can. I scored right around the average on first two midterms (65) and had to nearly ace the final to get an A- in the class. Midterms are really time constrained so rack up as many points as you can for the quizzes in discussion, go to your TA's office hours, and know how to do hw problems really well because they are harder than the ones that show up on his exams.	5	12/19/2019
		5 unit quizzes, a midterm and a final all online	2	12/20/2019
		Don't take it with prof. Chang. Can't understand a word she says and her final is hard af. I had a 89.86 and got a B+, she didn't care to round it to an A- even after me practically begging her. 	8	12/20/2019
		Professor Eichler was funny and passionate about the topics he covered. Study his lecture presentation slides and worksheets	3	12/24/2019
		Professor Bartel is pretty good, though he expects a lot. All exams are free response. He’s really generous with extra credit though so do the extra credit!	7	8/1/2020
		Took it with Fakwa. Two things that made me not like this class and changed an overall positive to a negative. He's pretty slow with teaching material. We were consistently 1-2 chapters behind the other classes and by the end, he sped through slides and it felt rushed. the other thing was the final exam. Might just be me but the final exam felt so different from the midterms in terms of difficulty. Still passable. I wouldn't say don't take him if you are looking for a super easy A but an A is achievable. 	7	9/30/2020
		Avoid Bartels at all costs. This man singlehandedly made my quarter hell. Midterms are all free response sketches and you only get 30 minutes to finish. The grading system was a mess. COVID really inspired this professor to make everything even more confusing than it should be. He basically hid our grades and made them impossible to calculate until after the P/NP deadline. He also made the final exam an oral interview. If you take this class with Bartels, also expect to go beyond Chem1A, because he starts teaching OChem stuff like Mass Spectrometry. He also gives out weekly discussion homework and homework every day (including holidays and weekends). Lecture clickers are graded on accuracy. Super difficult class for intro chem.	9	12/11/2020
		Took with Professor Hill Harman during Fall 2020(online b/c of covid). I highly recommend taking his class, especially if you're a first-year. It's a great transition from high school chemistry to college chemistry(especially if you took AP chem in HS). He's a pretty good prof and very kind and helpful. Midterm 1 was not too bad but he made midterm 2 harder on purpose to get the average score lower, but he does curve based on that. Midterm average is usually in the C range but it will be curved to a B- which is pretty generous. Go to lecture because he explains concepts that will be on the exam very well and does virtual clicker questions that you have to do bc they count towards your grade. The only concept he was kinda bad at teaching was hybridization so I'd recommend going to SI sessions for that. Overall, if you put in the work and don't slack off you'll be fine.	5	12/13/2020
		Had Eichler, even though we had things like quantum numbers and chirality, which weren't super huge focuses in AP Chem, the class was easy.	2	12/16/2020
		Had Bartels for Fall 2020 (corona time). Do all the daily homework (25% of grade), he assigned 60 and counted 40 with the highest grade you got. One practice and real midterm: both fairly difficult but he only takes the grade of the one with the highest score (you can't make it up if you miss one; he'll just take the grade of the one you took). Final was an oral exam that took like 10 min: groups of 3 and he asks you questions live in a circle. Clicker questions during every lecture so you have to show up. Discussion work was in a group once a week (basically just busy work). Caught cheating in a groupme so he might just fail 200 of the 300 students that were in his class. 	5	12/18/2020
		Fokwa was a great professor in my opinion, and his class was relatively easy and offered a lot of extra help during office hours. His exams were easy as well.	3	12/19/2020
		I had Fokwa during Fall 2020 and I thought it was an okay class. He's lecture heavy with a bunch of PollEv clicker questions. You don't really need the book to do well since his practice exams mirror his actual exams and he offers a bunch of extra credit with the PollEv and bonus test questions. As long as you attend lecture and pay attention you should be fine, discussion with the TAs also help a lot.	5	1/5/2021
		I had Fokwa in Fall 2020 and personally, I really liked his class overall. There were times where his lectures were kinda boring but there are also times where he really gets into his PollEv questions and lectures. He really wants his students to succeed, so he will help you in any way that he can (i.e. he matches your worst midterm grade to your final grade if your final grade is higher than your lowest midterm grade). This class is relatively easy in all aspects if you took chem in high school but don't slack and still put aside time for studying. 	4	2/24/2021
		Professor Genereux is extremely knowledgeable about chemistry and was receptive to students' needs. However, I found it difficult to understand his teaching sometimes as the explanations would skip over steps. I personally did not attend his office hours because I had other classes to attend but he was available for questions. This is not to say though that I did not understand any of his teaching. He answered students' questions to the best of his ability and tried to make class enjoyable, especially with it being on Zoom, which was very appreciated. I sought out outside resources such as the ARC's tutoring and YouTube videos that greatly contributed to my understanding of the material. The exams were especially difficult and even when I felt I had a solid understanding of the material, the questions were still hard to answer. Professor Genereux though was a very understanding professor and he provided many opportunities for extra credit, which was very helpful.	8	3/7/2021
		"Bartels was the cause of not one, not two, but three entire meltdowns that made me question my future career choices. I only took regular chem in high school and slightly struggled in that, so keep that in mind when I talk about the difficulty of this class. Clickers are questions that we had about one minute to answer during lecture and we did between 2 and 7 for every lecture and discussion. They make up 20% of your grade, so if you don’t understand a concept or don’t answer in time, you’re screwed, the bottom 20% of your scores from clickers are dropped. Group homework is done for the most part during discussion, and the questions have little to no relevance to the current course material. The midterm is 30% of your grade, and you really need to know your diagrams and graphs. If you do well on the practice midterm, you basically don’t have to do the actual midterm because he takes the higher score. The final is a short 10 minute oral final with two other people. It isn’t terrible if you know all your terms and diagrams, but he just tells you to study the slides so it's frustrating to study for - this is 10% of the grade. Online homework is assigned almost daily and at random times, so you have to keep checking if he posted the homework. It is quick, and doesn't usually take more than 10 minutes. 
"	7	12/2/2021
		Take Fokwa, he gives lots of extra credit. No curve for this class, but there is a redemption system if you screw up on the midterms. If you've taken AP Chem this is basically just a review of the first few chapters so not too hard, just study. Final exam was rough on everyone, gave everyone an extra 25 points. Advice: do the homework without looking up the answers and make sure you understand why the answer is correct. 	4	12/9/2021
		As a senior in STEM, this class was a piece of cake. Took with Eichler. However, a lot of freshman (mainly in CHASS) struggle with this course.	4	12/10/2021
		Eichler for CHEM001A is very doable if you put in the work to get the grade you want. His lectures were online except his discussions and his weekly online quizzes are open notes. His midterm was easy but his final was a bit brutal for some people (MCQ was the hardest part actually imo). Eichler is def easier than most CHEM001A profs but don’t slack off just bc he’s “easier”. Go to office hours, listen and take good, thorough notes on his video lectures, and review review review! Other than that, eichler is very easy to approach in office hours if you need any help and explains concepts very concisely. 	5	12/19/2021
		AVOID LAVALLO AT ALL COSTS. Prof gives unfair exams and teaches incoherently. My largest complaint is that he taught incorrect information because the correct information was “outside the scope of this class”?????	10	1/6/2022
		I always looked forward to Lavallo's zoom lectures but not because he's good at teaching chem. Most of class is him going on tangents about having fun with his best friend R-OH or him ranting about his iPad not working ever since he ran over it with his car. Basically a self-study course with 2 midterms and 1 final. If you score higher on the final than the midterm, he replaces your midterm grade with your final exam grade. HW is optional but you should do it because most of the exam questions come directly from the HW. Weekly quizzes in discussion for bonus points. It's basically impossible to fail his class since a 40% is passing, but you won't learn anything. If you are confident in your knowledge about the first two units of AP Chem and are looking for a low-commitment class, then take Lavallo.  	4	1/7/2022
		I had the course with Vincent Lavallo. The workload for this course is extremely light because there is no homework. Each discussion week, you have a chance to earn extra credit points which is really nice. The class is mostly based on tests, the final is a gigantic 60% of your grade and replaces your midterms if you do better on it, so make sure you study for the final. Your grade for this class is entirely based on two midterms and one final at the end, so study hard for them. Lavallo's tests are also very conceptually based, so you won't have to do too much work, just make sure you understand the concepts well because the questions he asks on his tests are tricky and can fool you if you are not prepared. There is a very large curve at the end of the quarter and the A cutoff for my class was an 84%	5	2/11/2022
		I had it with Joseph Generoux, easily the best professor ever!! very laid back, super helpful, funny, and wants students to get an A in his class. Open note tests and take home!! 	3	5/23/2022
		Took it with Fokwa for 5-week Summer Session A. He's kinda mid, not too strict nor the best. His lectures are kinda broad and not very informative as he recommends you to go over the lectures slides that he already provided before coming to lecture. He does a couple of clicker questions per lecture based on the lecture slides which could be tricky if you weren't paying attention to the lecture slides. He's generous on clicker questions where everybody gets full credit if 80% of the entire class got the question correct, and few extra credit questions on the practice exams that you can check answers with him through email so that you'll already know the answer to them during the exam day. His exams are almost similar to the practice exams, but he might add few trick questions that are specific enough that they might catch you if you don't pay attention on lectures and practice exams. Knowing the answer choices on the practice exams can also help you as well so that you'll know when the answer choices will be correct on the real exam questions with different wording. He only curves based on how many points between the student with the highest score to reach the perfect score which isn't that much. Since this is a fast-paced course, it's recommended that you try master your understanding on certain chapters/concepts within a few days before the exam so that you'll have enough prep to do well on the actual exam. If you don't understand his lectures very well, always seek outside resources like SI, textbook, youtube vids, etc. TAs might be helpful depending on how informative/strict they are. If you can't handle the fast-paced course, it's best to wait until next year unless it's mandatory to catch up your 4-year graduating plan. 	7	8/26/2022
		I had David Hill for chem001A. Class is graded on a curve out of 480 points. Quizzes count for 80 points, 2 midterms 100 points each and a final 200 points. Quizzes are free response and Exams are multiple choice. He tells you what is exactly on each quiz and on exams before them. The reason why class averages on exams are in high 60s is because they don't do the homework!!!! If you are comfortable with the homework you should get 80%+ on exams. 	4	12/7/2022
		Took with lavallo, he's very conceptual and focuses on bonding theories a lot. All his lectures were online, discussions were optional. He posts recordings but doesn't use slides for some chapters. Grading scale was 2 midterms worth 30%, final worth 40%, and optional discussion quiz for up to 10% extra credit. Midterms are group midterms and open everything, final is in person and no notes allowed. Lectures and course outline are confusing to follow and midterm/exam problems are way harder than the material in class. TAs help a lot and you can go to any TA's office hours, sergio and Anton helped me a lot. I ended up with around an A in the class, but I had to actively study and put in a lot of effort. 	8	12/8/2022
		Hartman is the best. It was his first year teaching and I seriously recommend him. He is so chill and his policies were awesome. You get a retake on your mini test and midterm in case if you did bad on your first attempt. Final score can replace your mini test or midterm score if you did well. There is extra credit in this class. His OLI homework and textbook system is very informative and I learned more chem than I needed to for this class which could be useful for chem1b. Make sure to put in the work and you’ll do just fine :)	5	12/10/2022
		Content is pretty similar to AP Chem (periodic trends, stoic, balancing equations, lewis structures/vsepr, electron configuration, nomenclature, etc). Overwhelming and difficult if you have never taken chemistry in high school. Professor Hartman is really good at explaining the content and is very understanding. Assigns weekly homework that is pretty time consuming, but allows retakes for every exam and midterm. Offers extra credit and participation points. 	5	1/2/2023
		DO NOT take it with Lavallo. You will end up mostly learning from TAs and the class was so bad the curve was a 86 for an A. 	8	1/18/2023
		Took this class Fall 2022 with Fokwa. Lots of buffer points from hw and the redemption system on the final which makes it difficult to fail. Only complaint is that he did not allow make ups for Poll EV questions which sucked because I missed class for a week because I was sick and didn't get any points back. Midterms and final were alright not impossible and didn't really contain trick questions just do practice exams and study the smartwork. Also, each exam had an EC bonus point that he gives out for you to work on before the actual exam so that was really nice	4	3/3/2023
		"I repeat and I repeat again to NOT take this class with Vincent Lavallo. Hands down one of the worst professors at UCR. I'm surprised he hasn't gotten fired yet.

He was so hated that the class discord server I was in had a special channel just to make fun of him for being so pathetic.

Extremely disorganized and inappropriate professor. There is no flow to his lectures and often you are wondering where this is going. My guy just lectures from the comfort of his own BED where he wears only boxers and an dirty undershirt. His conduct is completely disgraceful as an middle-aged adult man.

Self-studying is key. Your TA will definitely be useful since they feel sympathy for you. One of the TAs when I took the class was practically teaching the class when Lavallo should be doing his job. This TA was a lifesaver.


The class is test-heavy so do what you can to pass the tests. Final is weighted heavy as a percentage of the grade. 

Do very good on the extra-credit quizzes in discussion. You need the extra credit to not fail the class.

The only reason why the curve is good because of students over the years complaining about how the class sucks."	10	4/7/2023
		now i give this an 8, because I was forced to take this immedately due to the LC system despite having no prior experience in chem, so I struggled deeply. but if u took like ap chem prior or something, youll prob be good	8	6/9/2023
CHEM01LA	3.73	Read the lab manual and do well on quizzes and reports.  Don't sweat about doing poorly on the final.  Just make it above 50%, which is generally the average.	4	3/30/2017
		Always come to class with the previous weeks lab report and conclusion(unless it was already turned in) and this week's lab procedure and prelab. My TA was very lenient with grading imo. 	3	12/18/2017
		"Super easy. Labs are kinda boring since it's all basic stuff. For lab quizzes, just make sure to know the procedure and some background info from the lab you are doing that week and the week before that and you should be fine! For lab reports, just make sure to include everything that is necessary, and make sure to check your work on the ""lab report"" worksheet from the lab manual because points are taken off for wrong answers."	2	12/12/2018
		Always read the lab manual before you even start the class to get an idea of what you need to do. I recommend not doing everything last minute because lab is a chore and you have other classes to worry about as well (do a little bit everyday!). Pay attention to your syllabus in terms of deadline since sometimes you may need to turn in your lab report early. Just review the material ahead of time and ace the quizzes (you should be fine). 	2	12/14/2018
		Read the manual and underdtand how to do every calculation for the final and you’ll be fine. Average for my classes lab final was like a 50% but the test was basically all calculations with some concepts.	1	12/18/2018
		Experiments are easy. Just know the concepts and calculations. Manuals are decent at explaining calculations, but my TA was cool and taught us all the calculations before the labs started so that helped (for the few experiments that required math). Quizzes for 1A labs aren't hard either, just review pre lab calculations/ and the material in lab manual for that experiment and your good. The final tho.... that sucked ass. For not having so much calculations in 1A the final had mostly calculations lol. Study your pre-lab and quizzes for the Final. Final brought me down from an A- to a B+ :/, so just study well in advance and go to TA and hopefully you'll be alright.	3	8/28/2019
		If this is your first lab class, it will be a little tough. Be detailed in your reports, go to TA office hours, and be friendly with them. Study hard for the quizzes by reading the prelab in advanced (cannot stress that enough) and doing the prelab questions on your own. For the final, the curve (although usually pretty generous) is dependent on how your section is doing, so make sure you're racking up as many points as you can. Know all the concepts listed on the objectives sheet posted in ilearn because thats literally the layout of the final. Finally, if your TA isn't helpful, don't be afraid to go to another ta who can explain concepts better.	6	12/19/2019
		Make sure you use sig figs!!	5	12/20/2019
		Having labs online made it easier to not mess up any numbers since we just watched videos of the guy doing the lab. The most entertaining part was that has face had the look of someone being held hostage.	2	12/16/2020
		Use sig figs, be thorough in your lab reports. Grade depends on the TA that you have but it is normalized at the end.	6	12/28/2022
		Most labs never take up the whole 3 hours which is nice. The workload was too time consuming considering it is only a 1 unit class. Your grade depends on your TA because all of the work is graded by the TA. Dr. David Hill was really good. Gave thorough explanations and was really nice to talk to. He was a harsh grader compared to the other TAs, but the final and class was curved at the end. 	7	1/2/2023
CHEM001B	5.62	Not as easy as 1A but it's not too hard. As always just know your stuff	5	3/29/2017
		Had Prof Mueller.  If you read the book, going to class is optional.  Practice homework problems and know concepts in great detail.  Final exam is difficult.	8	3/30/2017
		Sort of easier than 1A. Jason Cheng is a really good professor and funny at times. A lot of concepts are taught so go to lectures. I had clicker so you might too.	7	3/25/2018
		Took with Quan Cheng. If you understand how to use formulas and have a good TA it's not that bad of a class, but Cheng does not explain anything at all.	4	2/19/2019
		Had Prof Davies. His lectures were boring (nice accent though) and basically annotates his slides. Had 2 midterms and they were both hard (class average was low). He uses PollEverywhere for participation and Smartwork for homework.	7	3/7/2019
		Took it with Quan Cheng. He explained everything thoroughly. Just go over the questions during lecture, clicker questions, and do the Extra Homework since some of the questions on the exam stem from that. Overall, this class was not that hard.	6	3/25/2019
		Had Yinsheng Wang, not a bad professor by any means, but his exams are hit or miss, either really easy or ridiculously hard. Material itself isn't too bad to grasp, just make sure to understand the homework. Best way to get an A though is to read the textbook before lecture to get a grasp of the material ahead of time.	6	3/26/2019
		Had Dr. Chang and he's honestly really boring and its more worthwhile to read the book than to listen to his lectures. He has clickers so you're forced to go to class but as long as you do enough of them then you could honestly just go for the clicker and then just ditch. Overall CHEM001B isn't bad but it's a little more difficult than CHEM001A. I heard from my upperclassman friends that it's the hardest in the CHEM001 series, but we'll see. Just review the end of chapter problems, do the practice midterm, review the clicker questions, and the homework before the midterms/final and you'll be set! BTW he gives a lot of extra credit opportunities.	5	3/31/2019
		Not very hard, but make sure you do plenty of practice problems to prepare for exams; also David Hill is one of the tougher chemistry professors	6	6/15/2019
		Going to lecture is useless if you have Quan Cheng. A great guy, but he doesn't know how to utilize his time. I just stayed in the back and left after the clicker questions. Go over his practice tests! He copies and pastes some questions into the test and it's just good practice if you don't go to lecture. 	6	3/27/2020
		Took it with Cheng and the midterms and final were super easy because they were mainly based off of the practice exams and the homework.	3	3/27/2020
		Had Cheng. Exams are straightforward and should be easy if you study the stuff he gives you: clicker, hw, practice exams, back of book practice problems. The stuff shows up on exams. His class breakdown is VERY forgiving. Lots of opportunities to earn extra points. Got a C- on first midterm, but was able to make up those points and get an A in the end. 	5	5/8/2020
		Had Proff Zhao. Chem1B is very mathematical, lots of equations and solving word problems. As long as you know how to use equations given, you’ll be fine. Zhao is a pretty good teacher, would recommend his class. 	5	5/8/2020
		I had Dr. Linlin Zhao. Great professor, easy to understand, pretty good policies in syllabus. 2 midterms, final. Content not too difficult. 	6	6/2/2020
		[COVID-19 SPRING 20] I had this class ONLINE with Linlin Zhao. Attending the Zoom lecture was recommended and he occasionally tossed in some clicker questions to reward those who actively attended. Chem 1B builds off of the information you learned in Chem 1A so it's good to brush up on some of those topics. Like others are saying, this class is a lot of equations and plugging and chugging. The word problems are tricky too. Each chapter was a new concept for me, so it took me a while (and a lot of Khan Academy...) to fully understand the concepts and how the equations worked. Reading the textbook is extremely helpful and he bases most of his exam questions off of what he teaches on the slides. Zhao presents his information pretty thoroughly and takes the time to help students who are stuck. This class moves fairly quickly, so understanding all of the concepts is vital to earning a good grade. Unfortunately, the exams are all closed book and proctored. Clicker questions (20%), discussion points (10%), and homework (20%) make up 50% of the grade (as well as potential bonus points). For us, the homework had unlimited tries and there was no penalty for wrong answers. There are 2 midterms (10% each) and a final (30%). The exams aren't curved (I think), but the final class grade is based on a curve. Overall, I enjoyed this class a lot and I recommend taking it with Zhao!	7	8/26/2020
		I took it with Prof. Tim Su and he was amazing. I still got not so good grades on midterms and exams (like Ds lmfao) and thanks to his generous grading ended with a B+. He was an amazing prof as he really cared about his students. I would definitely suggest taking Chem 1B with him if you can	5	5/17/2021
		Not very easy but not very hard. Had Eichler and it was asynchronous. He is very good at explaining stuff. Graded by weekly canvas videos, weekly quizzes, hw on chem 101, midterm, final and discussion attendance. He offered extra credit throughout the quarter and his grading scale was point based. No matter how much the total is, as long as you got a certain amount of points then you got the letter grade assigned on the syllabus. 	5	3/17/2022
		I had Timothy Su and honestly he's a good lecturer/professor. My only complaint is that his tests were nothing like the homework/lectures. The wording was different, which threw me off. At the same time, I guess I could've started studying earlier for them. He lets you have a cheat sheet during the midterm/final though, which was pretty helpful. I feel like I learned a lot through the homework and lectures but the tests/my grade didn't reflect that.	6	3/18/2022
		I had it with Tim Su, straightforward notes, chill professor. his practice exams are almost identical to his midterms and finals; very helpful! attend review sessions with the TAs they help a lot	6	5/23/2022
		Took it with Professor Yin in Summer Session B, he's an amazing professor. He's very helpful and caring during office hours. He's also informative when going over the lecture slides with enough details. His midterms and finals are very similar and exact to the practice problems, if you understand better on the practice exams, you'll have no problem on doing the actual midterm and finals. Exams aren't too hard, they're pretty fair and able to solve them. Really recommended him.  	3	8/26/2022
CHEM01LB	3.25	Easier than CHEM001LA.  Not a lot of new material.	3	3/30/2017
		Easier than Chem01LA. 	5	3/25/2019
		Little harder than CHEM01LA. No extra credit ;-; quizzes get a little more detailed. TAs make it seem like the final is going to be killer but honestly just review everything in your manual and the quizzes and you should be fine.	3	3/31/2019
		Honestly I feel like CHEM01LB was easier than LA. Maybe cuz I got the hang of it this quarter but I feel like the lab reports weren't as hard. 	2	3/18/2022
CHEM001C	6.07	It's all equilibrium, once you understand it it's no problem	7	3/29/2017
		Eichler doesn't curve. Go to class--he doesn't really teach the book.	7	8/10/2017
		Jiang was chill but no curve :(	7	1/10/2018
		Easier than CHEM001B. Jiang is fair, though no curve. Lots of clickers and unlimited attempts (no penalty) on HW. Midterms look like clickers and practice exams.	5	6/14/2018
		The early two chapters about acids and bases are the toughest in the course and the difficulty drops off as you move through the course. 	5	6/15/2018
		Professor Min Xue was extremely fair. His exams were all similar to the homework and study guides he put out for us. Gives out a lot of bonus points as well	2	12/17/2018
		Class was pretty easy once you can see the patterns to the problems. Jiang is great, clickers and practice exams similar to actual exam. You almost have to learn to do the types of calculations for clickers on the fly, but they are fair enough	4	6/4/2019
		Had Ming Tang. Kinda hard to follow at times. Midterms and final are nothing like the practice versions. Read the book	7	6/15/2019
		Took it Dr. Eichler, a very fair professor and makes lectures fun to attend. I thought it was easier than CHEM001B just because some were stuff that we learned in previous chem classes. He offers a lot of extra credit and clicker questions and iLearn quizzes (which are worth more than midterms). His exams have free response questions which are harder than multiple choice questions so look out for those.	6	6/15/2019
		Dr. Eichler is a good professor and offers a lot of extra credit. I would recommend him. However, he does do mc AND frqs for his midterms and final.	6	6/15/2019
		Easiest of the series. Jiang was fair. Exams resembled clickers and practice exams. Extra credit is available but only if you get really high clicker and homework scores	3	6/15/2019
		"Had Eichler. He's a good lecturer, but he had us do this ""creative exercise"" where you had to write 10 statements about a certain chemical situation and most of your statements had to come from the material you just learned (which sounds easy until you actually do it). His midterms were not anything like other professor's midterms that I'm used to. Each exam has about half your points in free-response. Final had some curve ball questions -- make sure you know your material from past chem classes in the gen chem series..."	6	6/16/2019
		I took it with Ming Lee Tang and the class was...strange. Discussions are only quiz-based and none of the material from lecture really gets retaught in discussion. Midterms and the Final are pretty tough and under a normal grading scale, I believe around 60-70% of the class would have failed. She's not a very approachable teacher and the same goes for the TAs. Luckily, she's not a cruel professor and curved the class so that the average student got a B. For reference, class averages for the midterms and final were around D-F range. I got above average twice(about 1-3 points above) and below average once(1 point below), and I got a B+ in the class. Tang's class is really a tossup	8	6/17/2019
		Had Ming Lee Tang. Decent lecturer, but her exams were DIFFICULT. practice midterms did not reflect the difficulty at all and no amount of studying could have properly prepared me. Got a low C on both midterms and a D on the final, but the curve brought me up to an A so there's that.	8	6/20/2019
		Had Professor Harman. Uses smartwork which is very good resource for studying for the final and midterms. It was his first time teaching 1C and so it wasn't the best but better than Hill lol, but still he was a good lecturer and made me want to go to class and pay attention. If you read/ skim the book (for the conceptual questions) and do calculations similar to the ones on the homework, you can get good scores on midterms. Final he repeated questions from midterms so do go to office hours and TA office hours to see your exam and review the ones missed. 1C material isn't hard but the chapter on acid and base and its equilibria was I thought the hardest. Easier than 1B though imo.	6	12/12/2019
		i have no problem with how test heavy the grades are but i really hate how the professor teaches in his lectures.	9	12/14/2019
		Had Eichler (think that's how he spells it). This was my easy class for the quarter so I was able to kinda neglect it and pass but it got pretty tough so that's how I ended up with like a C in the class. Also, c'mon fellas... his jokes are funny stop trashing on him for it 	7	2/3/2020
		Took it with Jiang. Highly recommend not taking with Jiang if you don't already have experience with gen chem (ex: taking a year of chem in high school/ap chem) because he can tend to be very conceptual instead of mathematical (and the midterms are mathematical). The poll/clicker questions can be pretty difficult because he doesn't really teach them beforehand so you're kind of learning as you go. The homework can also be frustrating because in the later chapters he doesn't do a lot of practice problems that are similar to what's on the homework. The midterms are pretty ok as long as you review the quizzes, poll/clicker questions, and homework. Practice midterm was helpful too because he goes over it in class. Overall unless you don't have previous gen chem experience it's pretty manageable and fair. 	6	5/11/2020
		Had Ming Lee Tang Spring 2020. Cannot lecture to save her life and her train of thought is so hard to follow. Exams are hard and can not be compared to her quizzes and homework assignments. She curved it so that the top 30% got an A, middle 60% got Bs/Cs, and the bottom 10% failed. 	7	6/12/2020
		Take MingLee Tang! She is really considerate of her students during difficult times (COVID-19, fight against police brutality). She responds to emails faster than any of my previous professors, and she uses piazzi which is really useful	4	6/12/2020
		"First half was super easy. Second half ramped up the difficulty. It's not too bad as long as you do the homework. I had Jiang. There were no ""replacing of the midterm with final score"" type of redemption. But due to recent world events, he changed some grading to a ""no risk"" type of final. "	5	6/17/2020
		(Fall 2020 Via Zoom) I gave this class 7/10 in difficulty because I had a hard time working through the calculations. It's not like math where you know exactly what equation to use. You have to be able to read the word problem and realized if an acid is weak or not and from there see which, of the various equations, to use. I had Dr. Xue. He is a laid back professor and does a good job at teaching the material. He applies it to the real world as well. Homework is assigned through smartwork and is due at the end of the quarter before the final. He also assigned practice quizzes which are really important because they are exactly like the midterms and final. There are 2 midterms and 1 final. Your better score is weighted heavier so that you get a better grade and exams are not proctored. He also offers 100 EC for good questions. Each question is worth 1 extra point. There is also a decent curve. I was at a C+ and got a B.	7	12/28/2020
		Take with Professor Xue Min! Still have to do your Smartwork Homework but test questions are just like the homework problems with different numbers.Quizzes are optional. Grade is just homework, midterms, and final. Tests are all open note.	7	11/18/2021
		Avoid ryan julian; class itself is supposed to be easy(ish) and his tests are open notes but theyre timed like crazy and he rly is out to get his students. He posts slides missing important information, and gives difficult problems on tests on purpose. 3 quizzes instead of midterms, final worth 40% of grade, he thinks a 50% average on his quizzes is good :(	9	5/23/2022
		I took it with Eichler while in-person lectures, he's pretty chill professor and informative in lectures. He also post lecture videos on canvas where you do them and there's also lecture video quizzes that's worth a lot of points like a video quiz question that's worth 5 points. Polleverywhere questions are based on the materials and lecture vids, so do the lecture vids first before going to in-person lectures. Discussions are mandatory where you have to attend all of them to get attendance points, but Discussion TAs are pretty helpful at covering materials from lectures, and materials that'll be on the exams. For exams, they're mostly average to some that are difficult due to being more of an applicable qs than conceptual qs along with calculation qs as well. There's also FRQs for the exam which is based on mostly calculations, drawing, and write to explain your answer. So, do the practice problems, asking qs to TA/Eicheler's office hours, form a study group, go to SI, etc. Overall course is 1 midterm, 1 midterm re-take, 1 final, lecture vids/lecture quizzes/qs, discussion attendance, and poll qs. Grading is based on points grade cut-offs, earn as many points as you can. Eichler also do some extra credit points from either completing his potential surveys, answering pizzara qs that students post, etc. 	6	12/7/2022
CHEM01LC	7.29	Standard material.  Arguably easier than LB.	6	8/10/2017
		The labs manuals are already poorly written from when you take 1LA, but the 1LC manuals were the probably the worst written. Vague instructions on calculations, and you better hope you have a good TA 	5	6/4/2019
		Hardest lab of the series. The calculations are a bitch because the lab manual is HORRIBLE at explaining how to do them. When doing the lab reports, refer to your prelab and it helps but still the lab manual is the worst one out of the entire series. Some more complicated labs but nothing too crazy and most of the times I was out with good amount of time. The final wasn't bad I got a decent score and I studied the prelabs and the practice final and read over the major points in the lab manual. Good curve though, but still try.	9	12/12/2019
		Compared to the first two of the series this one was ridiculously hard. I breezed through the labs the first two quarters and was stuck for hours each week trying to finish the reports. You better hope you have a good TA who answers questions unlike mine. 	7	6/12/2020
		(Fall 2020 Via Zoom) I gave this class 8/10 in difficulty because the labs were very calculation heavy and had many little details. The quizzes were also pretty hard as you had to be able to recall the lab details. However, if you did well in 1LA and 1LB then you should be fine. The curve is also decent when it comes to the TA grading adjustments. I BOMBED the final (almost everyone did),  and I walked out with an A-. Try to take it with Brandon; he's chill and super helpful when it comes to answering questions.	8	12/28/2020
		CHEM01LC lab is harder than the previous two CHEM labs. A lot that you need to go through the lab manual along with lots of calculations. There's always a possibility where there's an error in lab experiment that can ruin your lab report's calculations/results. Grading can also depends on the TAs, some would give partial credits if you did the experiment wrong. So, go to TA's office hours to double check with the lab report and pre-lab for accuracies to get the full points. In terms of the final, the qs are very tough based on calculations, what did you learn from all the experiments, concepts from the lab manuals, and sometimes asked what materials you used for the experiment. Overall, practice doing the calculations for all experiments that do required them and understand what you did for each experiment/lab manual. 	8	12/7/2022
CHEM005	6.00	Content and labs are similar to genchem, but the labs emphasize precision and accuracy. Difficulty depends on the TA and when you take it. Some TAs require 5-ish page lab reports for every experiment and others don't. There are 12 labs total, so try not to take it in the summer because it was a 5 week session. Writing reports will prepare you for CHEM125W.	6	3/2/2020
		Had it with professor Cheng in the summer, he's was a pretty generous and kind professor. He was pretty understanding and his examples were pretty easy to follow. Tests weren't surprising. and they were open book and open notes (no internet). He has poll everywhere questions and credit does depend on whether you get it right or not, but almost everyone got full points. Material-wise, it's all just gen chem stuff, but more in depth. Curve was really generous. As for labs, because it was in the summer, we had a 4 hour lab period every day (mon-thurs). During the school year it's twice a week. The TAs are super nice and helpful, and overall are pretty generous graders. However, your lab grades do depend on how accurate and how precise you are. Just be extra careful when using those micropipettes and you should be okay. Lab reports can be pretty tedious and long, but the calculations are pretty straightforward and you are allowed to use excel. 	6	11/9/2022
CHEM008A	7.04	Note: Formerly CHEM012A		
		Hooley is a tough grader but a better teacher	10	3/26/2017
		if possible, take Cassleman 	6	3/31/2017
		O Chem 12 Ais a a good challenging class, when you finally understand, it all clicks	7	3/29/2017
		Hooley: Posts a lot of his own problem sets and practice exams with keys that really help for the MTs/Final. Go to SI. Fast paced lecture, but very good teacher. Mechanism focused, doesn't like nomenclature. 	6	4/5/2017
		Casselman is overrated; 90% of grades is 3 midterms. Study and memorize everything	8	12/24/2017
		For Switzer over summer 2018 > class is very fast paced but I still passed, average of the curve is set to be a B- and the standard deviation for the final was around 30, midterms were 14-15. The average for my class was 60+ though, study smart. I recommend doing textbook questions BUT at the end of 8B he told us that the manual for Carey had lots of errors when he was going through hw and that he doesn't even actually do the questions. He does select them and put them on the midterm though which is odd pretty sure as a last minute resort. Also there's a seating chart for his tests but he didn't post them until literally right before the test, I remember once he posted it a few minutes before the test began and all of us had to shuffle	9	9/11/2018
		Hooley talks kind of fast. All free response tests. Gives a lot of study materials that really help on the test. 	8	12/14/2018
		Casselman is cool. Work on problem sets and invest in Organic Chemistry as a Second Language as a supplemental book.	4	3/30/2019
		dude casselman sucks he literally is like a 5 year old.  if you put him in a bad mood your grade gets affected. I rather take it with Pirruing than this mutha fucka	7	11/4/2019
		Casselman grades the exams very harshly. There is no partial credit. He does not teach well either. I would suggest taking Hooley or some other professor. 	7	12/10/2019
		Just study don't memorize and you should be good :)	3	12/10/2019
		Take with hooley, if you do his problems you will atleast pass his class.	7	12/15/2019
		Took it with Casselman. Good professor but class is very difficult. About 50% receive As/Bs. Grades are determined mostly by exams (85% - M1+M2+Final), the rest of the points is by online assignments which are easy. I recommend Casselman for people, but your success will be determined solely through your outside study. He gives practice exam sessions which are not there for learning but to get a grasp on the structure of the exams. I highly recommend you to get Organic Chemistry as a Second Language, it is the reason why I got an A.	8	12/16/2019
		I had Casselman for Fall 2019. Majority of your grade will be coming from the midterms and final exam, so it is important to do well on them. I highly recommend going to office hours and reviewing the material after every lecture to get used to it. Taking this class was difficult because you have to learn how to visualize and think in 3D to understand what is going on. Otherwise, if you are able to do that, you should be able to breeze through the exams just fine. For the exams, I recommend you to go through both the practice sets and the practice exam problems that Casselman gives out AND go to the review sessions! 	9	12/18/2019
		Casselman has almost no homework--which if you're like me and need a ton of practice problems is quite bad sometimes. His exams were fair but a little hard. He's an awesome lecturer though :)	8	12/18/2019
		Ochem is hard and definitely do not slack off! Stay on top of your studies and even get ahead so you can be more prepared for the exams. Do A LOT OF PRACTICE QUESTIONS, it'll definitely help (recommend David Klein's Ochem as a Second Language).	7	12/19/2019
		Casselman is a great Professor and made the class much easier	5	3/11/2020
		Took with Casselman. Honestly was not as bad as people say. As long as you study; go over the ppts, watch yt videos, go to SI you will be FINE!! It gets hard but as long as you keep up and do not give up it will get easy!	7	3/16/2020
		Had Casselman for Winter 2020. I had a good ass time in 8A because I used Organic Chemistry as a Second Language, so I highly recommend that and do the practice problems. Casselman is a really good lecturer and his teaching style is very simplified and breeze that it made 8A material easier. I didn't read the textbook at all and walked out with an A, just wrote down notes, studied that and did tons of practice problems. Oh and forsure go to the session reviews he holds, those help a lot in terms of going over how to do his exams and how he wants things which helps a lot. Highly recommend Casselman for 8A	6	3/30/2020
		I took it was Casselman while classes were online. The material is definitely difficult, so I would recommend going to SI regularly from the beginning of the course. Lectures are recorded and uploaded onto iLearn. He provides a lot of points with assignments which helps to balance out the final. Since we were online, we didn't have any midterms and our final was open note. Instead of a midterm, we had weekly in-class activities/learning modules based on the material covered that week. It was basically group-work, so they were just free points. 	8	12/16/2020
		Casselman did a great job adjusting for online. He keeps a google drive folder updated (daily) w the annotated slides, class activities, practice questions, and anything else from lecture. He also has a series of videos on youtube going over concepts in greater detail. No midterms, but a thorough final. Homework is based on slides and textbook, but still takes some thinking bc it's mostly free response. Tbh homework is more like a weekly quiz but you get a week to work on it. He also posts the homework keys, which is super helpful for final review. Oh yeah, he also hosts review sessions starting a few weeks before the final, they go over literally everything using practice problems that he then solves for you.	7	1/4/2021
		Took with Casselman, Winter 2021. Expect it to be difficult. Casselman's structure for the panoramic was top tier, most of your grade is homework/activities and as long as you have almost all of those points, the final will just decide if you get a C,B, or A. Go to SI discussions and just stay on top of your stuff. 	8	3/19/2021
		This course with Larsen is the reason for me dropping out of CNAS. 	10	8/24/2021
		"Winter 2022 Casselman was a good lecturer up until we were behind and he crammed 5 lectures into 2 days and expected us to have everything nailed. Exam was MC and free response. No homework. There is already a set grading scale, and emphasized on ""not curving"" 85% were exams. There was a lot of opportunities to improve your grade. STUDY EVERYDAY. Cramping simply does not work for this class"	9	3/19/2022
		this was a difficult class. i took larsen. i was absolutely positive i failed the class since i was getting 30s on exams when the averages were 50-60 range but i was so surprised when grades came out and i received a C-. so overall the curve was so fat but i learned absolutely nothing. i wish i went to office hours (i couldnt because conflicting with another class) to gauge how she was as a person but she seemed nice enough for an ochem prof. her notes are super disorganized though. i used youtube and it was enough to know some necessary things.	10	5/15/2022
		I took it with Casselman. He absolutely made CHEM008A more manageable to learn and understand well with the materials. His lectures are easy to follow and understandable. His exams are quite fair based on how much practice you've been doing from the weekly practice activity he did every Friday and the self-assessments. He's also quite helpful during office hours where he'll let you try answer the problems first, then he'll guide you the rest when you're unsure of solving your questions. Overall, he's a pretty nice and caring professor. If you want to succeed more, then do the optional textbook problems he will assigned which makes you more well-prepared, and/or get more supplementary instructions from the SI leaders which were also quite helpful to me for more understanding of what Casselman covered in lectures.  	7	4/1/2023
CHEM08LA	6.00	Easy if you spend a decent amount of time on lab work.  Final is easy if you read all the manuals again.	4	12/15/2017
		The lab itself is kinda fun but the post labs can be extremely hard since the lab moves faster then lecture at times. Invest in a chegg account and you will be ok. DO NOT sleep on the final, its not terribly hard but alot of people fail it and its worth more than half your grade	7	12/12/2018
		Memorize the manual aka look for bolded words and make sure to pay attention to any pictures or diagrams you see.	3	3/30/2019
		Relatively easy. Make sure to read lab manual before class, quizzes can be difficult and specific. Final is pure memorization, you are given 80 questions to remember and 24 will be picked out to be used in the exam. My only problem was with the method they used to distribute grades. I got a B with a 92. Hooley decided it was best to rank students in their lab section against one another. fk hooley	5	12/16/2019
		"Your overall grade in this class is determined by your scores in the lab reports and the final assessment. The final assessment is the easiest part of the lab. They will provide you both the questions and answers for the final assessment, so I recommend you practice these questions over the quarter on a regular basis to memorize the answers and score perfect on this category. What determined your final grade came from how well you did overall in the class RELATIVE to your peers in all lab sections. Many people found out the hard way that their ""raw score"" didn't not exactly correlate with their final score. (e.g. 94% raw score is actually a B in the class because Hooley gave out letter grades after ""adding the normalized lab scores (average ~200), the lab exam (average ~230), ranking the class and assigning grades based on that ranking. [...] Your grade is NOT dependent on a raw score, it is dependent on your position in the class."" So beware of that. :) "	7	12/18/2019
		Took it during COVID. Honestly your TA makes or breaks your experience. My TA was really bad, so I had to go other TA's office hours to get help with the lab reports. The labs weren't too confusing to understand, but sometimes they word things weirdly and I would need clarification on that. The lab final focused a lot on the material from experiments 1-5 in my opinion (chair structures, IR spectra, acids and bases are the main topics I can think of). Don't think you can study for the final in one day, because you won't be able to.	6	12/16/2020
		The overall lab grade really depends how much your Lab TA will be lenient or strict. For me, my lab TA was a first-timer TA. So, overall made my experiences in CHEM08LA a bit more lenient. For the materials/labs, it's very time consuming despite that it's not that difficult to them as there's multiple parts with repeated steps in certain labs. The very first wet lab made my lab went overboard on the timing since it took forever to obtain the necessary data. So, just plan ahead on what you will need to do and get started asap so that you don't have to wait in line to grab the necessary materials. In terms of the grading, it really depends on how well you do in the lab, the experiment data, and your understanding throughout the labs. So, just double check your understanding and lab report during any TA's office hours or by emailing for feedbacks/extra help.  The lab final were alright since it's based on the tophat qs and what you did throughout the previous labs along with calculation qs when doing reagent tables. Overall, the lab is quite average in terms of understanding the materials and the procedure you will be doing for each lab. 	7	4/1/2023
CHEM008B	7.95	Note: Formerly CHEM012B		
		Avoid Morton	10	3/26/2017
		Larsen jumps around when lecturing 	10	3/29/2017
		If you have Larsen, first of all I'm sorry, but seriously  just memorize all her notes	9	3/29/2017
		Take Casselman if he's teaching it. Larsen is an okay second choice, though she as a professor can be confusing. Avoid Pirrung and Morton. 	7	3/31/2017
		So much material. So little time. Stay away from Morton. Pirrung was good 	9	3/31/2017
		"Morton: Talks slow, writes slow, and yet you still are lost during lecture. Go to SI and find outside help. Become a master at and keep up with his ""unknowns"" example problems. Exams are very challenging and time pressured. Average 35-40%. Posts a couple past exams with no answer keys."	7	4/5/2017
		100% exam based	10	3/27/2018
		Hard grading and exams in Hooley.  His average is a B- tho.  Posts a lot of practice exams that are really helpful.  No need to read the book but definitely show up to class	8	4/2/2018
		Larsen: Memorize reactions & basic mechanisms. Mostly MC, free response is drawing products/starting materials. It's funny when she yells at people outside the lecture hall.	6	5/17/2018
		Hooley is a fair professor. Make a godly cheat sheet (aka copy down all your notes) and you will be fine.	7	3/30/2019
		had casselman for 8B. it was a lot of material, and he knows it so his exams arent that hard. As long as you know what youre doing and you feel comfortable with the rxns, you'll be fine.  if u care about your gpa, go to SI. 	8	6/17/2019
		had casselman for spring 2020. It was tough way harder than 8a. you NEED to go over notes and do practice problems, dont fall behind because theres so many reactions etc. Last 2 weeks of the quarter, he becomes super moody and thats when everyones grades drop so do good before hand. I was going to get an A but ended up with a B bc he gave me a 30% one the last hw when my hw avg was 92%. 	8	6/14/2020
		Took Spring 2020 with Switzer. His lecture notes are kinda dry, but if you read the textbook it helps alot as his notes are just a summary of the readings. I did the practice he assigned and a few did show up on the midterms (word for word) but you can get away with not doing them and still getting a decent score. FATTT curve for online 2020 (said he'd curve the same for summer 2020) and he is very caring as he made our final optional. Overall he isn't a bad lecturer but I did read the book and did practice problems as his notes are kinda dry.  	6	6/16/2020
		Kevin Kou is the best OCHEM professor I've ever had! His grading scale is really nice, his lecture notes are very clear, and although the exams are free response and pretty difficult, they are fair. As long as you do your part, you'll pass. He's very kind and truly cares about his students. the best professor at UCR 	6	3/17/2021
		I had Kou for this class during COVID and I didn’t really like his teaching method. He is a really nice guy but the exam format and homework doesn’t help at all. There are 2 midterms, both worth 22.5% and a final worth 35%. He gives out free-response exams, which don’t really make sense and for a class like organic chemistry, it makes learning the material for the class even harder. His practice tests and homework don’t really help when studying for this class. 	9	3/19/2021
		TAKE KOU!! best professor ive ever had and genuinely cares about his students which makes a big difference in a really difficult course like ochem. he did redemption on the final for winter 2020 but final was cumulative. VERY FAIR GRADER 	9	3/19/2021
		(Took online in Winter 2021) Dr. Kou is the GOAT. He cares a lot about his students, is extremely nice to everyone, and is always looking to improve or make changes to make the experience better for students. He always stays an extra hour or more during office hours and sometimes stays after lecture as well to answer questions. The content of this class is difficult and definitely requires a lot of studying, but his exams are fair. The problem sets are optional but definitely help a lot in preparing for exams. He grades fairly and he also allows regrades on Gradescope. He handwrites all his notes and they are really neat. Dr. Kou is probably one of the best professors at UCR and I highly recommend taking his class. He also bumps you up a grade letter if you are borderline. (I was ~1% away and he rounded up for me and I heard he rounded someone up 3% to the next grade letter, so he is very generous).	8	3/22/2021
		I had Dr. Kou for this class during COVID. Dr. Kou was one of the best and most understanding professors throughout the pandemic. You could tell that he genuinely cared about his students. Personally, I found the final to be the hardest, then the first midterm, and then the 2nd midterm. I would HIGHLY recommend going to SI as much as possible. I think that was the main thing that contributed to me getting an A in the class. He will also most likely assign problem sets throughout the chapter. I would also suggest keeping up with those, instead of saving them all for the week before the exam. The material in this course is inherently more difficult than that in CHEM008A, which is the only reason I would give it a relatively high difficulty score. 	7	3/25/2021
		"Kou (winter 2023): Dr. Kou is really nice, but be prepared for fully free response tests. If you're adjusted to a different professor's teaching style from 8A (like Hooley with his cheat sheets) and you can take them again, I would recommend it. Same grading scale as Casselman, same ""I won't curve"" mentality. Our first exam was curved by 2% (down to the highest score since no one got 100). Otherwise, the other two exams were not individually curved. The all FRQ with no cheat sheet can be really difficult, lots of mechanisms to know for 8B. Kou takes the notes with you during class and will stop to write down important points, he really does want us to learn. Lots of problem set practice and go to OH/SI if you can. I scored around average on all my exams and got all my participation (poll ev) points, should've ended with a D+, but because of my average scores and full participation, he curved me to a C (without me even asking!!). "	9	3/31/2023
		Take with Hooley if you can, his exams are hella curved, basically if you get around a 50% on each exam you'll definitely pass. DO THE PROBLEMS SETS AND MOCK MIDTERMS, it will all be similar to the exam. Overall if you put in the work its not a hard class.	6	4/6/2023
CHEM08LB	5.25	Harder material than LA.  Large curve overall	6	4/2/2018
		Fast labs. Not too much to memorize for the final. Keep a look out for emphasized detail in the manuals like color changes and specific processes.	4	3/30/2019
		Labs are generally easy and finished with good amount of time. TA wasn't too picky and the final was just memorizing the given questions and answers, so it wasn't bad. Sometimes the lab does go ahead of lecture so beware of that, but experimentally isn't hard as you learn all new stuff like C13 in the begninning.	5	12/16/2020
		(during COVID) Pretty similar to CHEM08LA in terms of difficulty. I would recommend completing your lab report as early as possible so you have ample time to ask your TA questions. I did that for the second half of the quarter and that helped my grade a lot. I would also recommend reviewing the corrections you get on your graded reports. My TA messed up my grading A LOT, so I was able to get back a bunch of points just by checking his work. The final was easier than CHEM08LA's final in my opinion. 	6	3/25/2021
CHEM008C	7.11	Note: Formerly CHEM012C		
		Take Switzer if you can, he's very clear about what will be on the exam and gives good lecture notes on ilearn	8	7/7/2017
		Not that difficult with Pirrung.  Just memorize all the obscure structures and generally know how to apply the reactions and you're all set.  He basically gives everything in class, so show up and take notes.	6	6/21/2018
		From what I've heard, difficulty is highly professor dependent. Larsen will make this class significantly harder than it needs to be. Content wise it's undeniably easier then 8B but if you had a good 8B professor and not so good 8C professor you may struggle. 	8	6/14/2019
		Taken with Switzer. The first half is very difficult as all the reactions look the same, but the second more biochem focused half is generally easier. Memorize switzers notes and the answers to book problems, as they always show up on the test and its free points if you know them. Theres 2 curves.	7	12/17/2019
		Honestly the class concepts itself are much easier than the others in the series, but depending on your teacher, it could be a lot harder than it needs to be. I took it with Larsen this quarter, which I do not recommend. However, if you have no other choice, memorize her notes and you will do well.	6	6/17/2020
		Not too difficult,	6	8/22/2020
		Took with Switzer Fall 2020. Three midterms and third midterm was our final and not cumulative. 8C is easier than 8B and there's less reactions as most of them just tweak stuff already learned in 8A/8B. First two chapters are probably the hardest of the entire class, and after CH 18/19 the rest of the class is biochem focused and generally the material is easier to understand as nothing new is learned, just apply ochem to bio which isn't hard. Do the practice problems as usual for Switzer as some pop up on the exam word for word and going to SI really helped. Easier than 8B though and not a bad time. 	7	12/16/2020
		Took it with Switzer online during Spring 2021. The actual material is not that difficult, but his notes are extremely vague so you have to do a lot of self-studying to gain a better understanding. I highly recommend going to office hours and SI and studying a lot for the first exam, and then taking it easy from there. His grading system is based off of curved exam grades, so the average for the exam is a B, one SD above is an A, and one SD below is a C. Also do as many of his practice problems as you can, as it will give you a better idea of what he wants you to focus on for the exams. 	8	6/15/2021
		"Took it with Prof Catharine Larsen in Spring 2023. In person. 25% MT1 (100 points), 25% MT2, 50% Final exam. All MC, except for some fill-in/draw the ""product"" answers. Mechanisms were multiple choice, just select the correct arrow pushing for the named reaction. This quarter it was in between Larsen or Switzer. I chose Larsen. Great professor, can sometimes come off as passive aggressive, but she is just doing her job and gives very straightforward and to the point answers. She is not trying to overcomplicate things. Streamlines concepts. Makes it easy to learn to learn the hard concepts. Office hours were helpful to answer questions and address confusion about the lecture notes/problems. She uploads her pdfs of her notes she writes in class under the doc cam. EVERYTHING IS IN THE LECTURE NOTES. No funny business. Relieved some of my test taking anxiety because she really isn't trying to trick you. Concepts are easier to grasp then 08B and seems like we learn less/less rushed but still there was a good amount of studying to do. "	8	6/9/2023
CHEM08LC	7.00	More guesswork in the lab work.  A little more difficult than previous quarters of chem lab.  Final is the same as always.  Pirrung writes them, so memorize the manual.	7	6/21/2018
		Taken online so the labs were different. Lab TA are picky as hell during online so really put in time and effort. I hated using the Marvin sketch for drawing the mechanisms so be prepared for that. 8LC final wasn't hard you just need to memorize the answers to the post lab questions. Just the TA I had was too damn picky lol. 	6	12/16/2020
		Took it online during Spring 2021. Lab was much easier than prev ochem labs. Reports are entirely based on NMR and are extremely short, so try to finish it during the actual lab period while you have the TA there. Don't underestimate the final; it was much more difficult than previous courses. 	5	6/15/2021
		Took this with Rena Hayashi in Summer 2021. One of the worst classes I've ever taken. The entire lab is figuring out NMR charts that are incredibly complicated and not intuitive at all (multiple charts have peaks that are on top of each other and are hard to decipher). The lab manual itself had a ton of typos and alot of the information was straight up wrong or came with some caveat. Also completely dependent on your TA. Mine wasn't helpful so I often had to go to Office Hours for multiple TA's per day. Labs were assigned Monday and due Tuesday, but ZERO TA's had Office Hours on Mondays, so I had to completely rely on the hour after class to get help. The final is also super scary and some questions were insane. I got an A by working day and night on Ochem and going to Office Hours almost everyday.	8	8/19/2021
		rena hayashi changed the whole grading scale and coursework for this lab class. instead of simply scanning in your observations and answering a few questions for the postlab, you are now required to write full on lab reports. you slowly work up to writing a complete report by the end of the quarter but tbh every report of mine was over 5 pages long. you CANNOT pass this class without going to office hours - manny’s to be specific. manny was a great ta and super helpful in office hours but he is a very true grader, meaning he won’t give you an easy A and goes by the grading scale that was created by hayashi. (took this fall2022)	9	12/17/2022
CHEM109	9.00	Yo, this class is some serious business. The exams are actually really simple in concept but you still need to bus' down for that A. Doctor Debus is an absolute G when it comes to asking for help and if you go to the discussions you should be able to pull off that A.	10	12/19/2019
		This class is the real deal. The material is confusing and unintuitive and ranges from thermodynamics to quantum chemistry. There will be moments where the notes make absolutely no sense no matter how hard you try to understand them. So getting an A is difficult, but not impossible, so long as you're willing to put more work in than usual. The curves are generous, and Dr. Debus gives homework that is (mostly) representative of his exams barring any conceptual questions, and those are generally straight forward. 8/10	8	1/5/2022
CHEM110A	5.40	Ok, this class is easy to understand, hard to master. You can score 100% on the exama if you do ALL evens on the back of the chapters. Kawai Tam uses chapter problems as the problems in her midterms/finals, so always do them as extra apart from assigned wileyplus hw, you can get an easy A this way while the rest of the class who doesnt do this struggles at a 50% midterm score	5	12/20/2017
		Don't cram for the final. It won't work. The most important thing you need to learn is how to properly label systems with flowcharts. The actual calculations are of little consequence. If you study regularly, you'll do fine.	7	12/23/2017
		Second midterm a lot harder than first. 	4	12/16/2018
		If you can do dimensional analysis and solve a systems of equations this class is a joke, professor Ivey is very fair and is understanding of a lot during covid.	4	1/2/2020
		material was not too difficult, definitely go to class tho, and brush up on math or you'll have a hard time 	7	12/28/2021
CHEM110B	5.00	Class is sometimes needlessly complicated because the prof micromanages everything from student time to ta discussions. do all the homework. If you work well on cheat sheets the exams are *doable* though far too long.	8	5/17/2018
		This class was insanely easy (I personally took this class with Professor Jingsong Zhang). Quite a bit of homework was due, but it is very manageable. All equations are given for each exam, and honestly it just comes down to whether or not you know the units for each of the variables or not. 10/10 would recommend. Very cool. Averages on exam were around 50-60%, but if you know the variables and have a general idea of what is going on (as you should) getting an A is VERY possible (especially since most upper division classes are curved based on their averages/standard deviations).	2	3/15/2022
CHEM111	6.50	Majority of your grade is based off of the labs. Lab reports weren't too bad but definitely go to the TAs' office hours if you're having trouble. No midterm. You have to do a poster presentation on one of the labs (randomly assigned), not too serious though. Final based on labs, simple data analysis.	6	4/13/2019
		(Distance Learning) Very little new content, but the labs and reports are long. Different TAs graded each report so the grading was a little inconsistent. Follow the guidelines they give for the report format and you'll do fine. Practice good time management. Final exam was multiple choice and open note/open book. Profs were helpful and nice.	7	3/23/2021
CHEM125W	6.00	A lot of information, but you're allowed to have cheat sheets on the midterms and final (1 for midterm, 3 for final). The actual content isn't that hard to understand. Labs aren't too bad in terms of difficulty, but expect to type up 3-5 pages for lab reports. Will also be using excel a lot for making calibration curves and tabulating data.	6	12/11/2018
CHEM150A	7.00	Beginning of the class was easy but gets tougher once you get to symmetry. Really important to understand symmetry as it relates to all material in the course after the easy stuff.	7	12/11/2018
CHFY007	4.00	Absurdly easy until the final project which they give you terrible instructions on. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK! In fact, you shouldn't get it in any form, as all of the ideas in it appear in a much better structure in What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 by Tina Seeling.	4	11/14/2022
CHN020A	4.00	winter 2021: completely depends on how comfortable you already are with mandarin tbh & your previous background with it. fun class	4	3/20/2021
CHN020B	3.00	Professor Shih is super kind. Lots of memorization as that is what Chinese is. Decently easy A unless mandarin is not your first language. 	3	2/6/2019
CHN046	3.00	winter 2021: v much a breadth course. couple excerpts to read or watch each week but the subject matter is SUUUPER interesting and opened my eyes to a side of Chinese history I never otherwise would've known about	3	3/20/2021
CHN101A	4.00	Taken with Hsu Shu-Liang for this class and the subsequent 2 (101B and 101C). Great professor that really gets you dialed in on learning Chinese. There are almost daily quizzes for vocab but are really easy. Be prepared for a lot of homework though, but honestly it really helps if you want to retain what you learned. Practice really does make perfect in language classes. There is a midterm, a final oral presentation, and a cumulative final. Attendance is definitely mandatory and the class size is usually under 10 people and the same people for A,B, and C usually. Fun class if you're serious about learning Chinese!	4	3/24/2022
CHN132	6.00	Do the reading, and do it before class (as instructed). It doesn't matter if you don't understand what's going on, at least you won't be hearing about it for the first time in class, and you can ask better questions in class. Generally the class doesn't have a lot of people and doesn't have a discussion.	6	3/31/2017
CLA010A	4.00	These entire Classics 10 sequence is usually taught by Raschke. She might seem a bit intimidating at first, but don't let her scare you, she's actually awesome and super passionate about what she teaches. As long as you go to class and actually pay attention (seriously, listening to what she says and emphasizes is the main way to make sure you are prepared for her exams) and take good notes, you'll be just fine.	4	6/26/2017
		Had Christopher Simon and there were boring lectures but he's a great person, consists of 3 quizzes, 2 mini papers, and a final. Also go to lectures because that's how he takes attendance.	4	5/31/2022
CLA010B	4.40	These entire Classics 10 sequence is usually taught by Raschke. She might seem a bit intimidating at first, but don't let her scare you, she's actually awesome and super passionate about what she teaches. As long as you go to class and actually pay attention (seriously, listening to what she says and emphasizes is the main way to make sure you are prepared for her exams) and take good notes, you'll be just fine.	4	6/26/2017
		take it with Christopher Simon! wonderful person, great lecturer, gives you study guides for the tests. tests are pretty easy as long as you stay on top of the reading (there isn’t much) and come to lecture. he does take attendance with an app, but his class is fascinating and I’d really recommend showing up! 	4	4/11/2019
		Prof Colbourn - just for my quarter(Winter21). I didn't even need to do anything. He made slides, explained everything, gave out the question bank which he'd use for the midterm and the final. Without him, can be pretty boring. Just ask anyone who took this class in Winter21 for the notes and you'll be all good.	1	3/4/2021
		Took with Colburn (only taught for one quarter in Winter 2021), but it was pretty chill - just take notes and use the study guides provided and you'll do fine. Two essays, one midterm, and one final. 	3	3/15/2021
		if you know nothing about greek mythology, do not take! the professor chris is super nice but if you do not know anything you will not do well. the class is interesting and the midterms are multiple choice but i was so bummed because i thought this would n fun to learn about. ended up dropping week 8 	10	5/31/2022
CLA010C	4.00	These entire Classics 10 sequence is usually taught by Raschke. She might seem a bit intimidating at first, but don't let her scare you, she's actually awesome and super passionate about what she teaches. As long as you go to class and actually pay attention (seriously, listening to what she says and emphasizes is the main way to make sure you are prepared for her exams) and take good notes, you'll be just fine.	4	6/26/2017
		Christopher Mark Simon - extremely friendly guy. Responds to emails quickly, gives a TON of extra credit, and graded our 15 point quizzes out of 10. There is a lot of readings, but you don't really need it  to do well in the class. Just take notes in class and enjoy the interesting topic of Roman civilization.  Very chill and relax class. Take if possible.	3	12/14/2019
		The professor is definitely an interesting and exciting professor, and you can really understand the enthusiasm he has on the topic of Roman history. It's a shame it was held in MSE 104. I got really bored and tired in that lecture room just couldn't stand being in there for more than 30 minutes. I remember having 3 quizzes with 2 papers and a final. Btw go to discussion I forgot to go every once in a while :/	5	12/25/2019
		Pretty easy class with Dr. Simon. He's a nice guy and a good lecturer. Attendance is kind of mandatory as he takes it with TopHat. No homework is assigned except for two papers. The prompts are kind of hard but the papers are graded pretty easily--I got an A on both though I did try. There's quizzes once every few weeks and you do need to study a little bit. Go to discussion sections. My TA, Vlad, was good. Note-taking is recommended because a lot of stuff he says isn't on the slides he posts. He has a few extra credit opportunities that boost your grade. Final was OK; it included MC and an essay which were straightforward.	4	2/28/2020
CLA012C	5.00	"Took with christopher simons, 3 essay topics given throughout the quarter, you need to pick 2 to write an essay on. Attendance taken at beginning of class through Tophat, quizzes also taken on tophat (based on readings from textbook).

"	3	12/30/2019
CLA040	3.33	Really fun, passionate prof	3	12/15/2018
		Professor King’s structure of his class made it very easy to keep up with and push yourself to do the lectures. I only found myself falling behind on the week he assigned a lot of lectures, but after that week he started to split up the videos more as he saw it was difficult for us to finish on time. I liked how the videos were only ever around 5-20 min chunks, which made them go by quicker. He had great organization and the class was very interesting 	5	12/28/2020
		Only 2 essays which are super easy. The lectures were all asynchronous and the professor really made the stories enjoyable. There is a lot of assigned reading but you can still pass with an easy A without ever reading it. His tests and quizzes are exactly like the lectures, so if you paid attention you’re set.	2	2/17/2022
CLA112	5.00	I took this course with Mathew Chaldekas and it was a fun class. There were three essays, one midterm and a final. The three essays were fine, but the midterm was a little difficult if you did not do the readings. This class requires you do the readings before class, or you will lose points on the quizzes. The nice thing about this class is that there is no discussion or lab, and the final is just one essay. The final was due before finals week, which freed up a lot of time.  	5	6/17/2019
CPLT002	8.00	Professor Sottong goes wayyy to fast in lecture and assigns way too much readings. If you’re taking it for a breadth class, don’t. It’s too much work for a breadth course.	8	3/25/2019
CPLT017A	7.00	Lot of reading. Specifics of reading will be asked and discussion is 20% of grade.	7	10/29/2017
CPLT017C	6.00	Took the class online with Dr. Kalu as the professor. There was a lot of reading, and the lectures were a bit unorganized (no powerpoints, just her discussing certain concepts in terms of what we were reading that week). However there was only a midterm, one research paper, and a final, so if you enjoy classes without much busy work required for a good grade, I would recommend this class. Honestly as long as you grasp some of the major concepts you can make it through with a pretty high grade.	6	3/12/2021
CPLT023	4.50	Dr. Anne McKnight is super nice and really doesn't try to make things hard or complicated for you. Mild importance placed on knowing Japanese names, which I'm bad at, and certain literary concepts. Take notes and pay attention and the work will be easy, maybe even fun. WEEB ALERT. Full of Japanophiles, so if you ARE one make yourself at home here. Me, I'm as American as apple pie, man. I play Call of Duty and stuff.	4	11/2/2021
		Professor McKnight is pretty chill and she enjoys teaching Japanese modern narratives to her students and even to those that are interested in Japanese culture or Japanese literature. The class is heavily based on analysis of Japanese modern literature like haiku, tanka, and other Japanese literatures. So make sure you're able to have some thoughts or your own opinions on Japanese literature for analysis. There are 3 response questions per week based on the lectures or readings, 2 multiple-choice quizzes that are super easy, and 3 papers. No midterm/finals. Overall, highly recommended for breadth course requirement or those that are interested in Japanese field if you're ready to do several analysis of the readings. 	5	12/7/2021
CPLT025	3.00	I took Intro to Sci Fi with Raphals online. It was a super easy class; there's only three assignments and three tests, but you won't actually learn anything about science fiction. The assignments were journals on each of the stories read in class, but she's really vague about what she wants so you basically just have to write a page on your thoughts. The tests are easy enough because they're all multiple choice or true/false, but the answers are really vague and debatable so they're a little hard to answer. It's super easy overall but its really frustrating due to unclear instructions and the professor not actually teaching.	3	4/2/2021
CPLT062	3.00	Minh Nguyen Fall2020: 9 Discussion assignments, 1 Essay, 1 Final. Optional zoom meetings and they count as extra credit if you participate. Class is about South East Asian literature and reading short stories from different areas. The stories are fun to read and engage with them, it’s important to analyze certain themes/topics as you read. Not much of a time consuming class and fun overall. 	3	11/11/2020
CPLT070	8.50	When I took this class it was offered online, and the professor was Anthonia Kalu. Honestly, the class isn't worth the stress that it puts you through at all. If I could recommend you not to take it, I would. Unnecessary amounts of reading, and a ridiculous amount of work assigned a week. Class was a total fail. Save yourself.	8	1/2/2020
		Heavy course assignments for a breadth course. 2 essays (6 page & 10 page) on top of an additional final exam that contains a timed 3 hour essay and 3 short essay questions. Along with 4 short essay quizzes, about 100+ pages of reading a week, and weekly journal entries. The course load was very heavy for a breadth course and especially during covid. If you have other easy courses, this class is a possible option. Course content was intriguing, but just heavy workload. 	9	12/28/2020
CPLT110	2.00	I had professor John Kim, super nice and chill professor. Just go to class and pay attention to what he's saying and you'll be fine.  He does one 250 word precis a week, one midterm, and one final, all online.  For the midterm and final, you can and he recommends you just copy paste your precis.  I never even read any of the material and got an A.	2	3/31/2020
CRWT046S	3.67	Winer’s a fun professor, pretty easy, just a lot of reading (~200-500pg book per week, every week)	4	4/11/2019
		Hardina is a very funny and chill professor. Lectures aren't mandatory and they are pretty boring. You read 1-2 short stories and write 200-500 word response for each story that is due by each class. It can feel like busy work but they aren't too bad. Depending on your TA, some grade harder than others. You have to attend discussion to talk about the stories we read for points. There is no midterm and one final essay about your thoughts on the top 6 stories we read. You can basically just do the assignments and attend discussion without attending any of the lectures to get an A.	4	12/1/2022
CRWT047S	3.50	Sara is a young professor & full of energy yet understands so she gives us 1 free mental health wk. Every 2 wks you type 2 poems & final was optional for us. Great class, live famous poet sessions a few times. 	6	2/17/2021
		I had Sara Borjas as my professor in Fall 2020, and she was the nicest, most chill and flexible professor out there! She spaces out her assignments over time, which gives you a lot more time for other classes if needed, and is really understanding if you need time off for mental health or any personal reasons. I had her class first thing in the morning, which I thought was rough, but she always started it off with some bomb music and had amazing guest lecturers! The material was super easy and it's okay if you don't think you're a good writer or anything, writers of all skill levels are welcome and her and her TAs will make sure you feel comfortable in their class. 	1	2/24/2021
CRWT056	2.69	You can write WHATEVER you want, but it is a lot of writing.	3	3/28/2017
		No tests except Final is writing a story	1	3/28/2017
		IF Waddell is teaching, take it!  Nice and easy way to get rid of a fine arts requirement. You can literally write about whatever you want.	1	8/23/2018
		Took with Prof Brandon Williams. Lectures are interesting but mostly opinions of other students rather than the professor lecturing... Easy assignments, just do them and you'll get an A. No exams or final exam. 	2	6/16/2019
		Easy to get an A, just a ton of writing	2	12/15/2019
		"Brandon Williams, what a guy. Lecture is 3 hours w sign in sheet. Honestly wouldn't be that bad if he actually used the time well. He uses the lecture as though it were a massive discussion. He spends very little time lecturing and prefers to hear what each and every student has to say about every little sentence that he or she found interesting in the weekly reading. 100 points total in class. 1 point per page of writing. weekly readings w weekly response essays and ""writing practices."" Each week these two assignments become a page longer, starting at 1 page and capping at 5 pages. Additionally, every 3 weeks or so, you write a story consideration (3-5 pages) in regards to your final project (5-10 pages). 20 points come from lecture + discussion attendance. Hated lecture, enjoyed discussion. Hated reading responses, didn't mind the other assignments. Also, idk what the final is bc he cancelled it when I took it (Fall '19)."	6	12/17/2019
		Joke of a class, you can sign in and leave. Literally bs your reading responses, final assignment (my story) and writing practices and you'll get a 100. Make sure you meet the page limit. brandons a chill guy tho	2	12/20/2019
		Brandon Williams. Class is 3 hrs long and all about people trading opinions. Useless except for the fact that he gave answers to the final...that he later cancelled anyway when people started sharing them. There are 2 to 3 writing assignments per week that take way too long imo. Looking at a solid 5ish hours per week at least of writing. Easy A if you just go to class for attendance points and do all the assignments tho. No exams.	4	12/30/2019
		Lots of weekly writing, but it's graded more on effort than quality. 	2	11/3/2020
		The class was very easy as it is essentially graded on effort rather than ability. However, it is quite a bit of work during the lecture and outside of class.	3	12/9/2021
		Super easy class but very useless. It feels like a rip off English class. It’s good if you’re just going for easy credit. Attendance for lecture is mandatory and she takes roll at the beginning but if you already know the basics of writing its unnecessary to pay attention. The majority of assignments are just short writings or poems due weekly but are usually very short.	2	2/17/2022
		There a few assignments to to every week and it might seem lie a lot, but they're all fairly easy.  The professor is amazing (Goldberry), She is willing to change her course to help her students and she's very understanding. You also have a lot of freedom in your writing.	2	2/23/2022
		I took this with Goldberry in Fall 2022 and it was a pretty easy class. A lot of writing, but it is a creative writing class, so what else do you expect. However, a lot of this writing doesn't take that long, so I think it was OK. Lectures were technically mandatory since she used Poll Everywhere for participation points, but you didn't HAVE to show up as long as you knew when a poll was up. There were exit tickets too which sometimes had questions related to the lecture, so if you weren't in lecture you have to get the answer from someone who did go. Every week, we were given a few assignments called spex that we had to do that were all graded as attempted or didn't attempt. The first three weeks or so,  there were a lot, but the amount decreased with each passing week and the spex never took that long to complete. I think the longest one probably took me 30 minutes, and that was just a one time thing - most could be completed in under 15 minutes. Also, Goldberry seems to be one of the few professors at UCR that genuinely likes to teach so that's a bonus.	3	12/5/2022
		Taken with Long, who is friendly and lenient with late work. Mostly busywork but noticeable effort still needed to get full credit. Content was easy, open-ended, and holistic.  One of the easier Fine Arts classes if I had to guess.	3	12/9/2022
		I took it with Professor Winer. There were weekly journals based on a portion of the readings. Journals were honestly time consuming but some pieces were fun to respond to. Make sure to attend your discussions and participate since the TA grades upon that. Lectures are long but interesting to hear many people's perspectives on the pieces and readings. Midterm and Final were both some form of creative pieces and you have a lot of freedom to write what you want. Fun class, easy A if you put in effort!	5	4/2/2023
CRWT057C	5.00	Taken online with Abbie Reese. Pretty easy class. There’s only one piece that you need to write over the course of the quarter. The second one is optional. The class itself is more of a workshop, you spend 90% of the time in class critiquing other people’s pieces as a group and rarely do you ever have to do writing exercises. Final is pretty simple. It’s just a revision of your own piece from earlier in the quarter and a brief reflection of the class.	5	12/30/2020
CRWT066	See TFDP066			
CS005	4.00	I had Dr. Linard as a lecturer; he was great. My TA (who runs/grades labs and projects) wasn't extremely helpful, but as long as you pay attention in lectures and show up to all 9 or 10 labs to the best of your ability, you will be fine.	4	12/13/2017
		Took with one of the TAs as the lecturer. One of the most unclear courses I've ever taken and the TA for the TA in my lab was no help other than to grade your labs that had very ambiguous instructions. I would avoid it because there's so many other classes that fulfill the same requirements as this one for a lot of majors.	8	10/29/2018
		Remember to stay on top of your game by reviewing slides & the included videos! All quizzes & worksheets are fair game with the lecture slides	8	12/12/2019
		The subject is confusing because the professors and T.A'S aren't good. I thought this would be my worst class, but this was my highest grade in the quarter. What got me an A are the labs. So be sure to do them and make sure they are right (T.A's will give you feedback). But the labs are based off of YouTube videos they give you to copy off of, so you're literally automatically given an A for your lab assignment. As for quizzes, just review the lecture slides.	3	6/4/2020
		SUPERRRRR EASY has few labs worth 40% of your grade but has literal step by step just do 2x speed, worksheets during class super easy and she just wants you to attempt it (no matter what you get she gives you full credit), 4 quizzes but she goes over examples and the worksheets, and 2 projects	1	2/24/2021
		take with professor bashar!! he's super organized and goes through labs/quizzes in class and doesn't give a final. material is much easier to understand if you attend lectures bc he teaches using thunkable.	3	5/28/2021
		Take this class with Sandra Ruiz. Multiple opportunities for extra credit, quiz reviews in class before the quizzes happen, the coding labs have clear step by step instructions.	4	6/8/2021
		Professor Yifei Ding is really great. The material isn't that easy, but she's really good at explaining it and makes it as easy as possible. The labs are very easy. 	3	8/3/2021
		"I definitely recommend taking this class with Sandra Ruiz. It's super easy and it's somewhat fun. The grade is made up of weekly labs, biweekly quizzes, biweekly worksheets, and two projects. The labs are straightforward as you're simply copying instructions she's provided. It's also pretty cool to design simple games or apps. Additionally, the quizzes aren't too bad. As long as you keep up with the lectures, you should understand everything on there. Likewise for the worksheets. They're basically the same as the quiz except you have three attempts and you're allowed to work with a partner. Lastly, as for the projects, they were a little more difficult as there isn't as much guidance. For the first one, you're making a quiz on Thunkable so you might have to attend office hours for some extra help. For the second one, there's a lot of freedom so you can practically design an app that does anything. The content just has to relate to the topic she assigns.

Overall, the course is pretty easy and I think it's an important one to take. It's also not very time consuming and offers a good amount of extra credit!"	1	11/19/2021
CS006	4.38	I took it with Jason Ott. No midterm or final. Only easy quizzes that he would tell you in advance and questions are very basic. Don't have to go to lecture on non-quiz days. 	1	3/18/2018
		I took this over the summer with Gustafson. It was an easy class overall. The only tests that you have are just MC quizzes based off the lecture material. Labs are very short and can usually be done in an hour.	1	7/28/2018
		Rusich is super passive aggressive. Its painful and hes so unorganized. His quiz averages are literally 50% this quarter. 	8	5/29/2019
		Took with Sandra Ruiz, it was a 3 hour Saturday class, online because COVID-19. Homework is answering questions from the book, easy. 5 HTML labs, not that hard, detailed instructions are given. Quizzes is just a mix of vocab and really basic HTML. No midterm, one final exam. Prof does kahoots and goes over labs in class. One group presentation at the end of the quarter.	2	6/19/2020
		this class is easy but don't take it with Ryan Rusich. He is so unorganized and extremely passive-aggressive. This man does not know how to use zoom and always a few minutes late for lectures and midterms, even for the FINAL. He copy-paste old materials with numerous grammar mistakes and rarely posts announcements. He promises you will get an A easily but that's fake. I end up with an A-. Too much work for a 4 units class.	6	3/16/2021
		professor ruisch is fine make sure you go to tas for help with code during office hours 2 online midterms and one final in person. goodluck with notes he allows zero time to write anything down	6	11/15/2022
		I took Ryan Rusich for Winter 2023. The class is not bad however his lectures are difficult to keep up with and take notes. More than anything when taking notes listen to what he has to say and not base it off of the slides. He's also really fast with labs and going over his slides.	6	1/27/2023
		AVOID Professor Montazeri. She was super disorganized and passive aggressive towards the class, even in circumstances of an uncontrollable mass power outage at Lothian. She basically read through/assigned all of Ryan Rusich's slides and resources, so it seemed like she only taught 1 section vs Ryan's 3 sections in Fall 2022 just so they could add more capacity. I got the impression that she never fully understood the material, and her attempts to help us on our labs never really proved helpful. The discord server that my section made was our saving grace, since the lab directions often had nuanced instructions that would only make sense in Ryan's own lecture and not Montazeri's (which I learned after consulting some people from Ryan's sections). But overall, the labs aren't too difficult and just quite tedious, and can easily take you a few hours to complete. The quizzes are also really straightforward and directly reference the posted lecture slides.	5	6/7/2023
CS008	2.42	3 midterms, no finals	2	12/19/2017
		Do the labs.	3	3/19/2018
		Just make sure you take it with a professor named Toby Gustafson 	1	11/22/2018
		take it with Toby Gustafson, he puts podcasts of his lectures online and tells you everything that’s on the test a day or two before. don’t bother showing up to anything besides review days and tests. 	1	4/11/2019
		Easy - Dont need to attend class except the day before where Gustafson gives you a verbal study guide. It literally is the exam.	1	5/29/2019
		Attendance not required, 3 50 multiple choice exams and online labs. Just go to class on review days before the exam, easy A with Toby G. 	1	6/15/2019
		Going into this class I really thought it would be an easy A. Most reviews on here said so. However, Toby made the class harder as a result of people taking the class for an easy A. The labs are an easy 3 hours of homework. The midterms are worded pretty confusingly, and he stopped telling everyone what exactly would be on the test as previous reviews have stated. The professor gets pissed pretty easily so beware. I ended up getting close to an A, but I spent a LOT of time outside of class. The material itself is not difficult, but the midterms can be difficult. Also, he stopped posting his lectures online, so attending lecture is a must. Overall, the class is not super difficult but it for sure is not an easy A, especially if you aren't a compsci major. 	5	11/18/2019
		No need to go to lectures. Study off slides for midterms. 2% extra credit labs offered near the end of the quarter	1	12/13/2019
		took with toby gustafson, never attended lectures, uploads slides online just study those, make sure to do the labs and do the practice quizzes because some questions come from that. Keep track of your grade bc he doesn't round	2	5/31/2020
		Took with Toby Gustafson. 3 midterms, no final. Exams really easy, just vocab. 4 HTML labs, can be frustrating, but not too difficult, detailed instructions are given. Pearson myITlabs that teach you Microsoft powerpoint, excel, etc. Attendance not mandatory, everything on exams is on his power-point slides though. If you only study from the textbook and don't go to lecture, you probably won't get above a B or C on the exams.	2	6/19/2020
		Had Mr Gustafson. Ask for as much help as you can for the labs and try to pay attention. The labs really help and teach you applications like excel and powerpoint. The midterms are multiple choice but NOT open book so really try to study the textbook and the notes! Mostly just definition type questions (an OS is... ___ ). Homework was just the labs so the class was very easy 	3	11/30/2020
		This class was a bit difficult for me since computer science doesn’t really interest me, but if you’re into computer science, this class should be a breeze. The lectures are quite long so a lot of times I would color rather than taking notes since the tests are not open notes.	7	12/28/2020
		I had Professor Gustafson(aka Elon Musk) Fall 2020 online. He never missed a lecture, and he was a good teacher. Midterms were not open note, and they were proctored via Zoom. Personally, the midterms weren't that easy for me. Homework labs took a while to finish, but they were manageable. 	5	12/30/2020
		I had professor gustafson and the class overall was a breeze. you do have to pay like $100 for the labs, and they're a bit time consuming but they are incredibly easy. the weekly quizzes are on quizlet and the midterms arent too hard (theres no final). 	2	1/11/2021
		Took Fall 2020 and it was a pretty easy class. 3 midterms, no final. The labs were pretty confusing for me so I recommend starting early in the week if you need to go to your TA office hours. Midterms were pretty straightforward and I highly recommend just studying off the slides for the midterms as basically everything was on there. 	3	1/31/2021
		"Took this winter quarter during Covid times. The class is not difficult at all. If you have used a computer and are able to memorize simple concepts it is an easy A. I got a B+ because I accidenly forgot one of the labs... there are 3 different places to keep track of your due dates so it can get a little messy. Overall easy class and chill professor. The only think that might get tedious is the ""coding"" which is not really coding, it's basically copy, paste, change a few things, boom. Most labs you can finish in 1-2 hours max. "	4	3/25/2021
		Gustafson, so easy, all midterms and tests were MC and labs were easy enough.	2	5/22/2021
		"Took it with Gustafson, labs are just online assignments that you can always get 100% on. For assessment, there's only a series of 5 ""midterms"" that are basically chapter quizzes and are multiple choice. He also always gave lots of hints during lecture of what would be on the midterms."	2	12/1/2022
		Took it with Professor Toby in Fall 2022. He was chill and class was overall petty easy. He recorded lectures so I would rarely be in class. He has no final just about 5 quizzes which are held through zoom asynchronous. Labs are annoying but are not hard. Easy class if you want to satisfy math credits (does not have any math)!	2	12/2/2022
		Professor Gustafson is the best! His lectures are helpful and he is actually pretty funny. Pretty chill class, labs can be time consuming but very manageable!	3	12/22/2022
		Took this class Fall 2022 with Gustafson. Pretty easy and all exames are online. If you spend time on his Power Points, you will get an A.	2	1/4/2023
		Took with Toby Gustafson, Winter 2023. 5 quizzes, no midterm no final. The labs are easy but take a little time and can be confusing, so make sure to do them early and ask TAs for help if needed. Study off the slides that he posts on the class webpage, and you'll get A/Bs. No real need to attend class.	2	2/28/2023
		Taken in Fall 2022; Take with Gustafson- I advise taking it later on with upper divs so you have less on your plate. You have 5 quizzes; no midterms or finals; all of the labs are online and asynchronous (they're a little time-consuming) so you can knock them out as early as you'd like. He posts his slides and records his lectures (so you don't even have to attend lecture); the quizzes are easy because they aren't cumulative and only cover like 2 chapters per quiz. 	1	3/13/2023
		5 midterms every two weeks throughout the quarter; easy class	3	4/5/2023
CS009C	6.00	"This was the first time the class was being offered, so it's likely there will be changes in the future. For Spring 2022, Paea LePendu was the instructor. Attending lectures and labs was necessary as not attending any would bring your grade down an entire letter. Paea was a good instructor that was pretty open to making any changes that could make the class easier, but his lectures were a little bit difficult to follow as he would sometimes talk about things that the textbook hasn't talked about yet. The start of the class (~ first 3 weeks) was definitely the hardest as there was a lot of material you were expected to read and understand. However, this is something Paea seemed to have realized and something that is likely to change in the future. The midterm was pretty easy; especially because Paea allowed you to redo the questions you missed as many times as you wanted, allowing you to get 100% on the midterm if you wanted. The final was somewhat difficult - definitely harder than the midterm - but it was doable as most of the questions were multiple choice and a majority of the questions required understanding slightly more than the basics of each of the topics. The labs are a huge portion of the class, so as long as do all the labs, you should, for the most part, be good.
Overall, the class wasn't easy, but it wasn't extremely difficult. As long as you put in the necessary amount of effort, you should pass the class."	6	6/11/2022
CS010A	3.57	Note: Formerly CS010		
		Just do the work and you'll get an A. I have a concentration in CS so it wasn't that bad for me	3	7/1/2017
		Easy class if you make time to learn programming. Each lab has about 5-6 assignments that take a few hours to complete. The two programming assignments take about 2 days and 3-4 days (respectively) to complete. Anything lower than a 70% on the final auto-caps your grade at a C-.	4	3/28/2018
		Just do the labs & HW. You can get by only knowing the basic functions. Easy A.	1	5/17/2018
		Stay on top of the reading and labs and you'll do great. Kelley Downy was a Great Professor! 	4	6/19/2018
		Super easy, even if you don't have any programming background. Covers basic functions, loops, vectors, etc. For those of you with a background in C or C++ this class will be a breeze. Make sure you go to labs, attendance is 5% of the final grade. Even if you do them ahead of time and don't show up, you'll get docked points. I ended up with an A- instead of an A because I skipped two labs.	2	12/16/2018
		As long as you understand Zybooks and can successfully complete the labs without much help, you should be fine. 	4	12/18/2018
		Took it with Kelly Downey. I had no previous experience with CS and got an A in the class, I found it really easy.	2	3/21/2019
		Had Kelly Downey, even if you have no programming experience (like I did), this class isn't too difficult at all. If you do the zyBook assignments, you'll be fine.	3	3/26/2019
		Avoid professor Rusich, Ryan at all cost. He gets really mad if you take pictures or use any electronics and calls out on you. When he writes notes in lecture, its so small that you have to sit in first few rows; he wants you too.... I don't know if its just me but he breathes very hard so its hard to concentrate and understand him sometimes. Another thing is that he makes us do the lab few days earlier than the due date for a non-procastination score which is like 5% of total grade... Other than that, the midterm and final is straightforward. make sure to do the zybooks.	6	6/3/2019
		Basic introduction to fundamental CS concepts, should be pretty easy for anyone who's programmed before. Just remember to keep up on the ZyBooks	3	12/10/2019
		I had Ryan Rusich as my professor. He isn't as bad as people say, he's very lenient on exams for giving partial credit. He will help you if you need help, don't be shy to ask questions. The class isn't too difficult but it's very important to understand the logic and the reasoning behind why you are doing something, as it will only help you better for CS012 onwards. Labs and programming assignments become increasingly difficult but manageable. The midterm was harder than the final but both are relatively simple and straightforward. Make sure to do all labs, programming, and challenge activities as it's just free points and it'll hurt your grade if you do not complete them.	4	12/12/2019
		Do not skip your reading! I know people who fell behind on the reading and it nearly cost them the whole semester. As long as you take the time to read and fully understand the zybooks content, the class won’t be very hard	4	12/13/2019
		Ryan Rusich -This class is really easy. You honestly never ever have to attend class since Zybooks is the main way the material is taught. Attend on Fridays though since in class participation activity is recorded.	3	12/14/2019
		I had Rusich. He was alright, didn't really get angry. Guess he loosened up his electronics policy because he let people take pictures with their phones. I learned more from zyBooks than from any lecture. Class was pretty easy as long as you could do the labs yourself without any help.	3	12/14/2019
		EZ Cash money, prof is the CEO of zybooks, ta was very handsome	3	2/11/2020
		Easiest class you will take as a CS major.	3	3/7/2020
		I wish I could take Kelly Downey again just for fun, her class was amazing and I  have never written code before.	3	10/9/2020
		Took it with Prof Frank Vahid Fall 2020 pandemic, was pretty easy as it is an intro CS course that doesn't require any previous knowledge of the material. 	4	12/28/2020
		Professor Vahid was very understanding and made sure that students came first. The course is naturally challenging, and that's why he made it so that you can work with people to complete assignments. He's readily accessible and super nice! Programs are really easy for the first 3 weeks. After that, you really need to try and understand the topics, cuz trust, they're not easy. Although professor vahid does an amazing job in lectures explaining the concepts and going through examples using those concepts, you need to do your part too. He does all of his assignments via Zybooks. Tip for the class, plan out your schedule because every week, there's 5 activities that you have to complete every week (some of them might be really short, some of them might take a long time). I started with 0 coding experience and now, I consider myself pretty knowledgeable now! Professor Vahid = 10/10, WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND	7	12/28/2020
		Prof Ali helped me out a lot. Definitely would recommend her. Also, do your readings before class and you'll easily ace it. Best of luck!	1	3/4/2021
		Avoid taking with Ryan Rusich, he does not teach at all pretty much and goes on tangents on other topics about CS that isn't related to the class material or what's being taught. However, this class is so easy that you really don't need a professor, just keep up and understand Zybooks.	2	5/22/2021
		Took it with Kelly H in winter 2022, she was a really good prof! Class is time consuming if you have never coded anything before, but it was an easy class just do all the labs + hw + start early on your programming assignments! I ended with a B+ and this was my first time ever coding anything!	5	5/2/2022
		Overall if you do your work you should be fine but there are so many so make sure you do it right after it is assigned. I regret this so much. Also be aware of the 70% final rule.	7	12/13/2022
		I took this class with Kelly Downey in Fall 2022. If you came into this class with no coding experience, she will definitely ease you into the subject matter. Do make sure to complete the zyBooks assignments on time, but I found that her lectures helped clarify most, if not all the topics that were covered. That being said, though, do not take the midterm/final for granted.	3	3/26/2023
		If you skim over the reading and don't do the labs genuinely for example using other materials that doesn't come from the book. You will fail the class. The class counts as a weeder course although it is the very first introduction to coding you will see in your life. Zybooks will be your friend, and make sure to studying 1 to 2 weeks before hand for the final if you get lower than a 70% you will automatically fail the class. I had to take it twice because of the rule. Do not slack off. Especially in this class.	8	4/3/2023
		I had a new teacher for the class and I barely tired. Ngl but the biggest thing I wish I knew was just do cheat some of the assignments to get full credit and then read and figure out how to do it because getting full points is more important.	5	6/9/2023
CS010V	5.00	Participate during the class lecture, just because the class is online shouldn't be left last. As long as you are focused to do the work, lab and class are the same. Other than that its the same. 	6	8/24/2018
		Try to get Vahid, him and Joe make this experience amazing.	4	2/18/2020
CS011	See MATH011			
CS010B	6.61	Note: Formerly CS012		
		Start your assignments early, and do the work. Honestly the midterms were not difficult at all. 	4	12/9/2017
		As a transfer student the first thing you'll realize is that the prof only teaches about 30% of the class. The student teacher aide teaches the other 30%. The Zybooks teach 40% of the class. The prof will just be there to answer questions and introduce the subject. The student aide will be actually teaching the implementation lol actually she'll just explain the projects for 10 min at the start of class then you're on your own. Thank god I went over topics in this class at my community college so I was familiar with mostly everything. 	6	12/19/2017
		CS12 is a relatively difficult class if you don't study the material and actually understand it. Midterms aren't too hard. Had to retake this class even though I had a B overall because I got a 68% on the final(anything lower than a %70 requires you to retake the class). Second time thru I got a solid A. Do your work thats it.	7	1/10/2018
		"The main reason I think people don't do well in CS012 is because they are babied by CS010 and lulled into a sense of security by how easy the class is. CS010 is very easy, but CS012 really picks up the pace.

Also if you take it with Miller, his exams have ""themes"", where the MC part of the exam will completely revolve around 1 concept. He'll usually give hints to what it is during class. He'll talk about some concept for 30 seconds and will say ""ya this might be on your midterm"" and then never talk about it again. When I took it with him, the theme of our midterm was compiler flags. It's basically his way of figuring out whether you went to class or not. Also, its his way of ensuring that if you only study the mock midterm he posts like the night before, you will fail, because he changes the themes every couple of quarters. The night before my midterm, he posted a mock midterm that completely revolved around argc and argv[], and because I studied just that, I completely bombed the midterm the next day, which like I said before, mostly revolved around compiler flags.  

If you take anything from this, just do your assignments on time, go to class, and take note on anything that he says ""might be on the exam"" and you can basically predict what questions will end up on the exam. "	7	2/11/2018
		Harder than CS10. I took it with Kris Miller. The programs and labs were okay, going to office hours helps, but the exams kicked my butt. He had some practice exams which helped a bit but you definitely need to study more than that to be ready for the exams. Make sure you understand inheritance, recursion, and linked lists.	9	3/21/2019
		I have Kris Miller for this class and overall you need to have a strong C++ foundation in order for this course to be smooth sailing . This means that you should be able to to work on the labs/programming assignments and complete them within 3 hours. If you are not confident or rusty with C++,  the course is still doable but you need to go to office hours (a lot) for any kind of help. Also, it is helpful to attend lectures since he will often leave hints on what’s going to be tested in the midterms and finals. Good luck!	7	12/17/2019
		Go to office hours for help on projects.  They will help tremendously.	7	12/17/2019
		Make sure to pay attention to what Mr. Miller says during lectures as he will often drop hints about what will be on the midterms + finals.	6	1/1/2020
		The class felt quite manageable and easy at first, but as time went on, the workload started getting greater and greater. This class is meant to be difficult and I recommend managing your time well and studying various concepts repeatedly to gain a better understanding of the course materials, especially for the final project.	7	3/15/2020
		CS012 is an extremely difficult class. Some upperclassmen have told me that it's harder than CS014, but I have yet to see that for myself. I took this class Winter 2020 with Jeffrey McDaniel. He's an extremely good lecturer with lots of knowledge of the subject of C++, although I do wish he would smile more (he kinda has that mean, scary face, but really isn't all that scary). CS012 is filled with content, and you have to be on your toes and learn quickly. If you find yourself falling behind then make sure to quickly get help via office hours. Both professors and TAs have office hours, and there is SI sessions as well. This course is not too bad up until the midterm, but the stuff after is very hard. Pointers, Linked Lists, and Recursion are all difficult topics, which difficult programming assignments. I found myself having to collaborate with people to get through the assignments, even though you are not allowed to collaborate. Please make sure you do not use GitHub code on your assignments, that's how many people got caught. Instead, get help from friends, TAs, and professors, they will often lead you in the right path and that way you make sure that you are learning the material. Definitely review pointers and linked lists before going to CS014.	7	3/21/2020
		Moves fast, hard concepts, be ready for lots of more programming 	7	3/21/2020
		The midterm and final multiple choice are hard	8	3/21/2020
		This class was really really hard even with quarantine mainly because of the programs Kris Miller gave us. Best advice I can give is make a study group so you guys can help each other understand the concepts. Pointers, linked lists, and recursion are some of the hardest concepts in this class. Really try your best to understand everything well and ask your TA for help! They’re very nice and want you to do well. Also if you’re struggling with concepts from CS010 don’t be afraid to ask because everything builds on it. Overall it’s a hard class but if you take the time each week to understand the readings and assignments, it’ll be slightly less painful.	8	6/12/2020
		Took this class online during the pandemic, so it was a little different from the usual course. Everyone told me it was super hard so i was prepared for the worst. honestly not bad at all though. the first half was easy. the second half was when things started to pick up. just make sure you do your programs early, take notes from zybooks, and you'll be fine. i say pay special attention to pointers and linked lists, bc those were some of the harder topics for me to get down and understand. don't worry too much about this class but definitely be prepared to spend a lot of time on it 	6	6/12/2020
		Had this class with Jeff McDaniel. He was extremely knowledgeable but I could not for the life of me understand his teaching or learn from it. I went to a the majority of Kris Miller's lectures who was teaching it at the same time and found him to be extremely clear and helpful. 	8	5/22/2021
		(Spring'21 -online) - Prof Kris Miller - Big step up from CS10A, but manageable, TA Uday Saini was the best, THE BEST!! - Do the assignments ahead of time as it would be a big pain to do them at the last minute - Definitely don't skip over any concepts as they are very important for further cs classes. Good luck!	2	6/14/2021
		I had the course with Kris Miller. Go to lecture because he sometimes says topics that will be tested on the midterm and on the final. There was a decent curve at the end of the class and he grades pretty fairly for the midterms and finals. The programming assignments can take a long time for this class so make sure you start early. The first half of this class is pretty basic and the material is not that hard. But in the second half of the class after you start learning about pointers and linked lists the class becomes harder. But make sure you pay attention in the second half of the class because you get a good introduction to algorithm analysis and data structures, which is the foundation of what you will be doing in CS10C. Also, my TA, Hariri Venkatesan barely knew the concepts so if you get her don't bother asking her for help and go to a different TA instead. Overall, manageable class if you put in the work needed.	6	2/11/2022
		Greater jump in terms of difficulty from 10a. Where in 10a you focused primarily on builidng familiarity with C++, in 10B you begin learning higher level concepts and build similarly more difficult programs. With that being said Professor Miller is an amazing professor who knows his stuff well. If you take it with him, make sure that you reach out to him about anything that you may be confused about because he does a great job at visualizing concepts for you to understand. Show up to lecture, take notes, do the reading/challenges and you will pass.	7	5/19/2022
		The concepts in this course build upon each other so I recommend not slacking off in any form. When you are on top of things, the class is not difficult and the program assignments end being fun instead of draining.	7	8/13/2022
		Had Kris Miller online section. Dude is a great professor that's passionate about the things he does. Teaches pretty well and is pretty understanding. Make sure not to fall behind and actually try to pay attention during his lectures.	6	3/17/2023
		Final and quiz are the hardest part. My quizzes were worse then leet code and my professor messed them up in class. Final was even harder	7	6/9/2023
CS013	5.00	Class is difficult but not impossible to pass. If your instructor is Ryan Rusich :  Labs,100 points ; Assignments,100 points; Lab Attendance,20 points ; Readings,100 points ; In-Class-Exercises,100 points ; Weekly Exams, 100 points. No midterm (If class votes for no midterm at the beginning of the course). Completing all readings thoroughly should be enough to understand the concepts, however, in order to learn the actual syntax you should attend office hours, Google search code and maybe watch a couple of YouTube videos. (Instructor Ryan Rusich covers concepts more than syntax)	7	3/28/2018
		"This class was super easy to pass but harder to actually remember the content
DON'T just do the work for an A if you are taking more CS in the future
the course material is essential for many of your future cs classes!!!"	3	8/24/2018
CS010C	7.86	Note: Formerly CS014		
		Harder than CS12, but manageable. The projects require much more work than 12	8	3/28/2017
		Avoid Mart Molle if you don't feel like you have a solid foundation in CS10-12. Always start assignments as far in advance as possible. Class is typically curved a lot (out of sheer necessity).	10	3/31/2017
		One of the most challenging lower division cs class. AVOID MART MOLLE AT ALL COSTS	10	3/31/2017
		"Probably the hardest lower division CS class out there. Some people say CS061 is more difficult but I highly disagree; CS014 is much, much more difficult contentwise. CS061 is ""effort-based"" and CS014 is ""intelligence-based,"" would be the best way to put it. It is DS&A after all, so this should come as no surprise to CS students, just make sure you put in a lot of effort and build a solid foundation for CS141 or you will seriously regret it."	10	6/28/2017
		Honestly I thought I was gonna fail this class but the curve literally saved me. The material in CS14 is pretty damn hard. You have to understand the concept thoroughly in order to be able to the programs. I took this class with professor Evangelos so I was pretty lucky. I got an F on the final and a D on the midterm but still somehow ended with a B+ in the class. I'm pretty sure he curved the hell out of the class cuz I'm pretty damn sure I was supposed to fail.  	7	3/28/2018
		"MUCH harder than cs061 (with mart molle)
hardest lower division cs class by far"	10	8/24/2018
		Take time to complete the programs and labs. This will give you a strong buffer before going into the midterms. Also, McDaniel is tough, but understanding so try to be well-liked by him before finals.	8	12/6/2018
		Took with McDaniel fall 2018. As background, I *thought* of myself has a strong competent programmer coming into cs014. Yet this was certainly the hardest class I’ve taken yet and it was the last of my lower division. Labs and programming assignments are straight forward IF YOU GO TO OFFICE HOURS. The hard part is certainly the tests. I aced everything in labs and programming assignments and still failed the second test (38%.) Multiple choice is e z p z but short answer is 60% of tests and will destroy you. Especially coding/ drawing in pencil. MASTER data structures and standard library member functions and the rest will follow. Good luck. You’ll need it	9	1/6/2019
		By far the undergrad class with the MOST work. Not the hardest intellectually. If you breezed through CS012, you have the capability to breeze through 14. You dedicate time to your programming assignments (esp 2-3 trees, they will fuck you over.) If you struggled in CS012, you will have trouble in 14, beware. The concepts are straightforward but the programs require time to implement.	8	2/13/2019
		I had Dr. Lependu, and honestly the class isn't that bad. If you put in the time on your programs and study the material you will do well in the class. His midterms are a reflection of what he teaches in class so ATTEND LECTURE!!! make sure to ask him questions if you need help, he is very nice and bubbly.	7	5/30/2019
		Paea's midterms were extremely easy but the final was difficult 	4	6/18/2019
		Had Vagelis, the class itself was not too hard. IMO the material was more interesting than CS012, but the assignments are very time consuming , yet manageable so DO NOT slack off on them. There's a very large curve at the end, went from a D+/C- to an A.	6	12/17/2019
		I had McDaniel in Fall'19 and passed with a B. The labs and tests weren't too bad (focus on studying the slides), but the assignments were tough as shit in my opinion. You have to work on them in groups of at most 3, and the person I worked with was absolutely no help, so make sure to get a good group. The TA's weren't much help on the assignments either, so START EARLY. The final was also very difficult, but I think he curved the class because I'm pretty sure I averaged around a 70% overall. Just keep up with the pace of the class and you will be fine.	8	2/3/2020
		Reem is good.	7	5/8/2020
		Programming assignments were extremely difficult to implement. Labs also get progressively more challenging. Tests weren’t too bad. A big step up from CS012, know your CS012 stuff before stepping into this class (linked lists!)	10	5/16/2020
		[COVID-19 ERA] This class with a Professor Paea LePendu was a pleasure to partake in. Data Structures and Algorithms is an initially scary class as the jump/learning curve from CS012 was drastic and you had to be really confident in your ability to program. If you don't understand the concepts from the previous class, beware, this class will be difficult programming-wise. Conceptual understanding wasn't a problem, as LePendu really makes sure people nail that portion of the subject. It's not too difficult of a class but taking it online because of COVID-19 did add some learning struggles. The midterm was easy but the final was HARD. I do wish that some of the programming labs that were smaller in size would be 1-person labs as working on them with a group meant you didn't do much coding on your own. More coding practice would've been better as all technical interviews pull from the knowledge you learn in CS014. The most fun CS class so far, though coding some of the challenge activities was mentally stressful lol.	9	6/11/2020
		Had the class with Ali Reem. She was a very nice professor, so I did not struggle as much, but again, make sure you understand all the concepts!	6	7/25/2020
		A massive step up from CS012 but as long as you understand the basic concepts and how to implement them in code you should be fine. In terms of the types of questions you'll be asked in programming interviews this class covers them the most so PAY ATTENTION if you wanna get a job later on. 	6	9/4/2020
		Took it with Evangelos Christidis (fall 2020, online), would NOT recommend. It was hard asf especially with the assignments we got no help/feedback on. lecture was really boring, but theres a huge curve at the end so dw about failing.	8	12/20/2020
		Took it with Vagelis Hristidis in fall 2020. Wouldn't say it was easy as he would make up program assignments all on his own that were very difficult and required us to know things we've never seen before. But at least they were graded pretty generously. 	5	2/23/2021
		Projects take a lot of time, give yourself a lot of time. Make sure to thoroughly understand all the data structures and algorithms on a conceptual level, which will carry you through the exams. 	8	3/31/2023
		Take it with pat miller, not silas. You must understand pointers, as data structures are just an application of pointers and what the entire class is about. be prepared to work and go to alot of office hours	8	5/9/2023
CS061	6.71	Do all homework assignments; the final is basically a collection of past homeworks and quizzes.	10	3/26/2017
		Hardest lower div cs besides maybe 14	10	3/28/2017
		Read book, google quizzes, start projects early, ez A	1	3/27/2017
		Lot's of programming, quite difficult to wrap your head around initially, moves very quickly. Has typical CS requirement (70+% on final or fail class)	9	3/31/2017
		The class isn't that bad. Just read the textbook and do the homework assignments, and you'll mostly be fine. First half of the class is extremely easy overall, but it does get more challenging afterwards. Quizzes should now be done in groups, and Linard let us use notes and the textbook when we did them. The final is pretty much based off of the homework and quizzes. Midterm isn't that bad since it should only cover the beginning material where it's still easy. Later programming assignments can get time consuming, but they were never really that hard as long as you're smart and just start early.	6	4/3/2017
		Linard will destroy you if you do not honestly study for this class, the concepts are simple, but this is a weeder class.	4	4/4/2017
		Midterm was not that bad due to the topics covered. I highly suggest to go to any SI session, if offered, because the class starts to pickup after the midterm. Get down the data paths associated with each instruction (Professor Linard provides the data path diagram in the final, but it's the simplified version which does not have the gates and muxes). Finally, start the programming assignments early, and this applies with the labs as well (it is not difficult if you understand how the opcodes operate).	7	6/26/2017
		I had the fortune of taking this class with an individual who had already taken this course prior. He pretty much carried me through the quizzes (group quizzes), i think we averaged a 9/10 with lowest dropped. The quiz problems were similar to last quarters problems. Midterm was decently hard, but again similar to a previous quarters midterm. I believe i received a 95% on the midterm. The class as a whole though 18% got an A on the midterm. Final was much tougher. (remember, you need 70% or higher to pass the class). I believe the uncurved average was something like 55%. Lucky for us, he bell curved it to increase the average to 66.6%. I would have failed the class, but luckily ended up with a 72% on the final after the curve. Programming assignments aren't too hard. Labs are killer. Homework is ok, just at least attempt you'll get 100. The midterm and final is the toughest part of the class. It's pretty much a mandatory class for a lot of BCOE majors though, so good luck	8	6/28/2017
		The class is really easy conceptually; just pay attention and try to study at least a little after lecture to consolidate things. The material builds on each other very quickly and there's a sharp spike in difficulty around the middle to end of the quarter, so be wary of that. People that fail this class often don't put enough effort into it(some people just don't get it too, obviously).	5	6/28/2017
		Was doing well throughout the entire class didn't study Register Transfer Notation for the final now I have to retake the class. 	9	12/19/2017
		The class requires plenty of time and attention. Do the homeworks and understand them, read the book and take notes, and go through old quizzes and practice midterms/finals. Don't slack off.	7	12/23/2017
		"It's hard to describe the difficulty of this class...
The first time I took it I automatically failed because of a stupid technicality but then i took it again for an easy A"	5	8/24/2018
		Just read the book and you'll be fine. Linard is great, people just don't like him because they expect to just not read and pass. Make sure you know the datapath and register transfer notation like the back of your hand. Tests are made up of weekly quizzes and problems from the homework. Like any other CS class, you need at least a C on the final to pass the class, otherwise you're capped at a D+.	6	12/16/2018
		EZ Shit. Study data paths and it's auto 90%+	1	12/17/2018
		Second hardest CS undergrad course. Unlike CS014 however, this relies less on brute force and time and more on intellectual capability. Some people will struggle, some people will breeze through this class. As a precaution plan to make some time to study, and LISTEN to the professor during lecture, he is very helpful and will save you time banging your head against tutorials and powerpoints. (Took w/ Linard)	6	2/13/2019
		Had Kelly. There's a pretty large learning curve to the class and the fact that she lectures pretty quickly doesn't help too much either. However, the class is very manageable if you are able to get the hang of it. The midterm and final draw many questions from the weekly quizzes that are given in lecture, so make sure to study them.	6	12/17/2019
		Linard was a good professor, but he went really slow. I don't think he helped that much in class with the last half, at least it was really hard to follow along. However, if you asked him during office hours the attention he gives you individually really helps you understand. The grading is pretty strict, but he's been known to give exceptions to some people (for example, I was allowed to turn in HW late, I'm a girl so idk if that has anything to do with it or my friend who's black also was caught cheating but was allowed to re-submit his assignment and passed the course). DON'T CHEAT! My friends got caught. He puts specific things in the template to catch the cheating. Also the TA Robert Colvin was the most helpful, but you have to walk through this logic in your head with him or classmates, or you'll never be able to catch up from falling off the boat at the early part of the term. The HW was pretty easy and even if you have the wrong answer, as long as you gave a credible, honest working to your solution, they'll assume you did it right and give you full marks. There are 5 projects and are pretty annoying because they go through an auto-grader in gradescope, so start early. Correspondance in the course goes through piazza, which is a bit annoying. The quizzes are pretty hard, but open book/resources. The final for our term (Fall 2019) was unlike anyone's final and REALLY bad. The midterm is hard but if you overkill yourself studying it's really not that bad. He gives plenty of resources to help. 70% of the midterm/final is multiple choice anyway.	9	1/6/2020
		The in class quizzes are open note and very easy. The midterm and final use many of the same questions as the quizzes and sample exams so as long as you study those, you should be gucci. The labs and assignments take a fair amount of time but nothing too crazy (2-4 hours of coding).	5	1/11/2020
		Class was hard but it was doable. The subject is new so there is a learning curve but the teachers are great, they give you all the resources, and it is NECESSARY to read the textbook.	7	3/21/2020
		Concepts were easy to grasp IF TIME IS PUT INTO STUDYING IT. Read the textbook. Labs and programming assignments sucked. Labs progressively become more and more challenging. In week 1, you’ll code a couple of lines of code, by week 10 you’ll be coding 500+. START ASSIGNMENTS EARLY	9	5/16/2020
		"""You will NEVER be an engineer"" - BL"	8	7/15/2020
		Took with Allan Knight, super nice and passionate guy, but the structure of the class was the same as Linard's so it was hard asf. Start early on labs and assignments (lc-3 was the hardest part of this class) and FORM STUDY GROUPS early on, this class cannot be done alone	8	12/20/2020
		On god the hardest lower div CS class out there, don't care what anyone else says, this class is NOT HARDER THAN 14/10C. This class is brutal and will push you to your max and the labs/programming assignments get exponentially harder as the quarter goes on. Midterm was difficult and you need to really study for it, and the final had everyone stressing as you have to get higher than a 70% on it to not fail the class. 	9	12/21/2020
		bro u gotta read the textbook otherwise this class is miserable	9	12/21/2020
		Midterm was kinda hard, but final was very easy. Try not to wait until saturday to start the program assignments. 70% rule was removed for the winter 2021 but I'm not sure if it'll happen for future quarters. Do the weekly homeworks with a group of 4 as its a lot less work for each person. 	6	3/23/2021
		Had this class with Kelly Downey. The concepts were pretty difficult and the midterms and finals were decently difficult as well. Her teachings were sort of clear. You don't need to read the textbook too much with her but as long as you keep up with lectures and get the hang of it, you should be okay.	7	5/22/2021
		Took it with Brian Linard both times lol. There's a lot to learn. If you wanna pass the final look up LC3 data paths and register transfer notation. I had to sit in a room with a buncha other students watching a video about those data paths until we all memorized it. I've seen people fail for cheating in the lab but I've seen more people pass after cheating so... 	7	11/7/2021
		Labs and programming assignments (coding in assembly language) can be long and quite time consuming if you get confused, but if you make sure to learn from each one, they're not too bad since they build upon each other. The midterm/final are more conceptual, and very similar to the practice exams, so if you do the practice ones, they're not too bad.	4	11/12/2021
		I think just spend time with lab and the program will help a lot with the grade.	7	1/5/2022
		I took the class with Allan Knight. Allan is a very caring professor, I recommend taking classes with him. The class requires some memorization. It was a fun experience learning how a processor works.	5	3/24/2022
		Lots of assignments just like the cs010abc series, this class will take time. Take it with Allan Knight over anyone else.	7	5/30/2023
CS100	7.00	the whole class was essentially one big project. Build a linux shell. But it's done with partners, and my partner did pretty much nothing. Choose your partner wisely.	9	3/27/2017
		If you don't have a solid CS10-CS14 foundation, this class will be harder (I didn't have a solid foundation, hence my 8 rating.) Start the work plenty ahead of time. Take it with a reliable friend with a good work ethic.	8	3/31/2017
		You have one big project(done with a partner) in this class that's basically a Linux shell written in C++, which you complete in parts as the weeks go by. It's not too difficult but it will take a lot of time trying to figure out the correct functions to utilize to get it working in C++.	5	6/28/2017
		Hated this class with Jeff. Get the textbook and study off that, much better than lectures/slides for exams. The labs are easy but assignments are killer. Do not procrastinate on them, you won't do well. Lots of reading up on system calls which sucked.	8	12/27/2017
		Find yourself a good partner, this is a team based class. People complained through out the entire quarter on how an individual was doing all the work. We had a graduate student as a prof and he didn't really explain the design patterns or uml diagrams well. This is one of the classes that reminds you that Community College CS classes were amazing because you actually had your prof teach you the material during the labs, here you learn it all on your own.	7	3/27/2018
		As long as you do the labs and try understand them, you should be fine on the design patterns that you will be tested on. There is a linux shell project that you should not procrastinate on and should definitely begin working on the day they are assigned because you'll be spending a lot of time learning how to use the required functions and THEN implementing them. Depending on how you program your project, you may have to go back and rewrite most of it so be careful in your design choices. The last assignment is going to be horrifying if you did not code the previous ones well. Overall, it's an alright class with a time-consuming project. 	7	12/12/2018
		pretty fucking difficult, the professor talks extremely fast that its hard to process, couldnt understand jack shit, the powerpoints are the only thing left in this humanity for this class. the midterm was brutal, the assignments were probably the hardest shit i have ever done in my life. it required time, sacrifice, patience, never giving up after many seg faults error with that stupidfuking terminal that u cant debug and ya but nonetheless it was a journey 	8	12/15/2018
		"Took this with Professor Crites and this class requires a lot of time, especially if you are a transfer student. It's a huge learning curve from writing small programs to designing and coding an entire Linux Shell throughout the course. The design patterns may seem easy to understand in the slides, but when asked to apply them, will be difficult. Do yourself a favor and ASK FOR HELP. For the first couple of weeks I went to the professor's office hours almost every chance I got. 

I would ask the professor questions that I would consider to be base knowledge for many students, and Professor Crites was more than helpful in answering my questions and informing me on what I should catch up on in terms of prereq knowledge. Super approachable professor who will go out of his way to help you. The tests aren't all too bad if you review the slides and understand the gist of the design patterns. 

The assignments and labs are what you should focus on if you want to pass the class. If you do well on them you can pass the class on the basis of labs and assignments alone. The main project that you will be working on throughout the course does not really require any specific design pattern, so it's up to you to decide how you will design it. My advice for the assignment is think of the long term and make sure that your code is flexible and able to add features relatively easily. Otherwise you will run into the issue that I and many students have in this class where you will find yourself rewriting your code almost every assignment in order to meet spec and make things work. You will not be allowed to switch partners for assignments (at least I don't think) so choose your partner wisely. 

Labs aren't too bad, except the instructions for the labs can seem kind of vague at times and most of the time will be spent figuring out what the hell you're actually supposed to do or what the output is supposed to be. But once you understand the instructions it's not too bad. 

DO NOT, wait until the day or even a few days before your assignment is due to start your code. I've tried it, don't bring that stress and anxiety upon yourself like I did. You will lose your mind. You will question your major. Don't give up, always ask for help and everything will be okay. "	9	12/19/2018
		"Took this class with Crites. The class wasn't extremely difficult, it was just very time consuming and tedious. Lectures are straightforward and if you miss a class the slides will be posted online. The textbook is recommended, but get it anyways because it will help you if you get confused from the lecture slides. Labs are chill if you have a good partner, but beware of the hammer server, it's such a pain to use.

The midterm was so bad he had to curve. The final on the other hand was MUCH easier, split up into two days so the final lecture was the multiple choice portion and the scheduled final day was the conceptual/written portion. Make sure you know how to draw UML diagrams properly because they will show up on both midterm and final.

The assignments are basically the final project but split up into 4 assignments, so each assignment builds from the previous one. You have to build a C++ shell, and he does not teach any of this during lecture so read up on it early before he starts posting assignments. If you screw up an assignment, you have to go back and fix it before you move onto the next one. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD PARTNER. Be prepared to lose a lot of sleep and skip classes to finish these off. GO TO OFFICE HOURS, Crites will help you and explains things a lot easier."	6	2/5/2019
		Big fun 10/10 (difficulty)	10	3/23/2019
		This class was hard because Crites assumes that everyone just pops out of the womb knowing linux. Pick a good partner. Focus on the labs and the assignments. Lectures are mostly worthless if you're keeping up with the work, with the exception of the last one on ethics. There will be questions verbatim from that lecture on the final. 	8	3/29/2019
		I took this course with Brian Crites. The only hard part of this course is the project. The actual material is fine, because you get taught the subject abstractly before you apply it in lab which is very nice. The labs are essential to passing the exams. The project is a bit difficult because of the documentation that has to be read and the partner you have. My partner did some work later on in the quarter, but the beginning was all me. So that made it difficult for my partner to understand all my code. I eventually finished it all, and it was fun.	7	6/17/2019
		Make sure you get a partner that will not slack off on you, otherwise you are screwed. 	10	10/22/2019
		still have PTSD taking this with Crites 	10	10/28/2019
		"Crites, I think the labs/class project was easy but the disconnect between his Lectures and Labs/the class project was insane. The most useful thing in the course (unit testing) was glossed over and not once brought up in a meaningful way in the course, he just linked us to someone else's paper on it. Which was very vague and not helpful in applying our skills. Everyone else seems to say that he was helpful, but despite going to office hours he was very curt/unhelpful to me. I'm not an idiot and could hold my own in conversations with him, but I received the most help from my peers or those at the transfer center, who helped me walk out the logic of the unix terminal without giving away the answers. The grader for the course, Luis Garcia, was one I had to constantly fight with because he graded things super late. He graded our major class assignments during Week 11. Crites also added ""ethics assignments"" that I think as a minority are pretty insensitive. One was ""define your personal definition of hate speech"", wtf? I'm all for adding representation to social issues and the consideration with technology is a good idea, but this was a horrible execution. He's gone now so idk if this is relevant anymore."	7	1/6/2020
		"PRAY TO EVERY GOD THAT YOU GET LUTFOR, ""Md Lutfor Rahman"" is the BEST professor and it's because he's also a student so he knows EXACTLY what we're all going through. He's updated the slides from Crites and made them better. He DOES have a pretty thick accent, but he makes up for it by being super cool and lenient with grading schedules + helping us out so forth. The brunt of the responsibility of this class is the shell project, so try to start it early by yourself. You will be building a linux-type shell, it's pretty hard to build so fast (and yes, you'll be building the whole thing, they just reveal more features as the quarter goes on), so I'd get a headstart."	4	3/20/2020
		The labs are simple as long as you do it on time and don't procrastinate. The exams were easy as long as you understood the design patterns and how they work. Took this with professor Md Lutfor Rahman spring 2020. 	6	6/20/2020
		A lot of busy work and projects, instructions always unclear from Professor Reem, made the class more difficult then it should have been.	7	12/21/2020
		Honestly, wasn't as bad as people make it sound. Its more about what your life is gonna be like in the actual cs industry rather than learning more code. Pretty cool	6	2/18/2021
		Do yourself a favor: expose yourself to design patterns before you take the class. Learn Strategy pattern, so you can get a good wraparound on what a design pattern is. The class is a great feel for how it's like to use your programming language in practical applications like industry. The hardcore stuff is the design patterns, so if you got those down, the class should be an easy A if you put in the effort. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT PROCRASTINATE ON THE LABS.	7	3/19/2021
		Professor Ali was awesome. But to get an A you really have to understand the software development methodologies and design patterns to do well. Also pick good a good lab partner and final project group.	5	3/29/2021
		Had Professor Ali for this class. Very important to choose a good lab and project partner to work with you, you'll depend on them heavily. If your partner is very bad or very poor in C++, you will most likely have a more difficult time in this class.	7	5/22/2021
		This class is HEAVILY project-based so make sure you get a good lab partner/final group. We had 3 exams that made up like 23% of our grade and the other 75% or so was all from the labs and the final project. The final project replaces the final so start it early so you're not up till 5 grinding the day before it's due. Most of the actual course content is just learning git and design patterns, so make sure you know how the design patterns work before the exams. 	5	6/16/2021
		Exams were tough but luckily they weren't worth too much. Last lab on the visitor pattern was really hard so try and get that out of the way asap. Start the final project early and make sure your uml diagram has the two design patterns shown in them by the time phase 2 is done. Get a good group and make sure your groupmates are contributing code to the project frequently	8	6/21/2021
		As people said before, if you are a transfer student and dont know c++ you are going to struggle. for labs you have to know pointers pretty well and for the project you have to know how to link together files and understand cmake which isnt really taught in the actual class, you're just supposed to know. If you're not a transfer student though, it really isnt hard at all. midterm and final was really easy and labs had extra credit if you did it early. If you get a good partner for lab and a good group for project youll be fine.	3	12/8/2022
CS105	6.27	Easy A. Professor Saloum is really nice and doesn’t expect too much from her students. Stay on top of the work and you’ll get a good grade	4	5/8/2020
		The labs are pretty easy, but don't take this class with Professor Strzheletska. She gives quizzes that have nothing to do with the labs and cover topics she only discussed for less than 5 minutes during lecture.	6	11/4/2020
		Took it with Elena. Whatever you do don't take it with her. It was her first time and the overall structure made no sense and had little organization. She assigned the final project in week 8 and gave us week 10 midterm alongside it. Much of the lectures only broadly go over the topics and the slides are ripped from websites and YouTube videos. The slides themselves are unhelpful and hard to follow. Her instructions are also very unclear on her expectations and even if she says she's aiming to give you freedom in your choice of how you do the project, she will grade you harshly. The class itself is not that difficult, but just do not take it with her at all costs. The only reason I struggled was due to her.	5	12/16/2020
		Took with Elena, if you have a good lab partner like I did the class is pretty ez, the midterm study guides are pretty vague so that is the only issue, do well on the final project, not the hardest class in the world, but not as easy as Elena makes it out to be	6	12/22/2020
		Class shouldn't be too bad but Elena makes it terrible :(	8	12/12/2021
		"Took it Fall 2021, I despised having elena strzheletska as a professor, I don't know why she's still employed at UCR. I was interested and excited to take a class in Data Science so I took this class but her inability to teach and assign course work in a manageable completely RUINED the experience for me. she was extremely rude and unprofessional: she threatened to give quizzes if students didn't show up to her monotonous boring 8 am lectures, verbatim told us she wants to make us ""suffer"", when the majority of the class would show up and a few students would be coughing she would complain about that. she never went over Python examples even once during lecture (most likely because she has no idea how to code), assigned a final project, quiz, and a midterm (which was essentially a final) all during week 10 right before finals. her instructions are so vague and she never provides any clarity on project and quiz requirements and grades students extremely harshly when we have no idea what the guidelines are. she makes mistakes on exam questions often and students have to be the one to correct her after the quiz deadline passed. the course content is not too difficult but please save yourself the stress and take it a different quarter with anyone but her, it's worth the wait. I am not lying when I say she is truly one of the most incompetent professors in the UC Riverside CS department."	6	12/13/2021
		"Took the class with elena, the topic isnt too crazy easy even, but she makes the class like ""difficult"" if you get what i mean. Spontaneous with announcing pretty important stuff, like ok we need to submit our project idea right, but she only made the announcement of it being due on the day of during the weekend with like 4 hours left to do it? she did that like 2 more times, and the last time was crazy with telling everyone to do an academic integrity statement a week after her final and making it due the same day with like 4 hours left to do it, that would have ruined me if i didnt have a friend in the class who saw"	7	6/19/2022
		avoid elena lol very last minute communications and unclear expectations	6	8/31/2022
		Elena makes my life miserable again with her unnecessarily harsh grading of the mini-project and final project, taking off points for things she never even specified in the rubric. Expectations are through the roof for no reason. Also her quizzes focus too much on definitions and examples rather than calculations which made my grade suffer. so please study those as much as you can.	8	12/18/2022
		I took this class with Elena Strzheletska in Winter 2023. Some of the content in this class I already learned from CS170 and CS172 which made it easier for me to understand the content. Professor Elena is honestly not the best at teaching since she just verbally lectures on the material shown on her lecture slides during class. It would have been more helpful if she went over more examples in detail. There were two midterms that were a bit too long to finish in the span of like 50 minutes. I barely had enough time to finish my midterms. Elena ended up curving in the end but getting an A can be kind of difficult. We also had a mini project and final project which aren't too difficult but make sure to write explanations on your projects/report otherwise you will lose a lot of points. We also had quizzes that were all mostly take-home but one in-person quiz. Overall, this class is not too difficult but the grading can be a bit strict sometimes and I wish we had more time to work on the midterm exams.	6	4/3/2023
CS108	2.00	First time this class has ever been offered. Easiest computer science technical elective i've ever taken. 5 written reflections(20%), 3 python assignments(40%), 2 quizzes(5%), and a final project (25%), and participation (10%). Professor Salloum is one of the best professors in the cs department here.	3	4/3/2023
		Took with Mariam Salloum. Super easy class. Write a one page report (single spaced) five times for each special presenter. Discussions are pretty straightforward, where you work on the assignment the professor provides (with a partner). There is a group project, where you work with 2-3 other people and choose a dataset and analyze the bias behind that dataset and give a presentation on it. It's online, but discussion is in person, both are mandatory attendance.	1	4/4/2023
CS110	8.20	First time this class has ever been offered. Took with Professor Mariam and she's super sweet and cares about the students a lot, definitely will listen to any feedback students give her. Course structure: 35% labs, 30% final project, 30% quizzes, and 5% participation. Honestly not a difficult class but super unorganized, which is not a surprise considering it's a new class being taught for the first time. Mariam was super understanding of all of the students and even removed a couple quizzes/labs as the quarter went on, and made the final project grading basis easier. Not a bad class to take if you want to learn the fundamentals of web development but for a class like this where the technology used in industry is constantly changing everyday, it might be better to self-learn it.	7	6/2/2021
		"Introduction to Web Development

I took this Spring of 2021 when it was first offered as a class. I rated this a 7 mainly because of how Web Development is in the real world where technologies are quick to rise and quick to die meaning that there are a multitude of concepts and stacks to learn. 

I came in with about 3 years of previous web dev experience and I was able to tackle all quizzes, labs, and final project fairly easily but if you have no experience whatsoever, it will be pretty hard because of the sheer amount of concepts that you need to learn on the fly and apply to your labs.

For example, lab 1 was a simple static mock twitter page. Lab 2 and 3 extended on lab 1 by adding in data fetching, sorting, and live updates from a JSON file. Lab 4 was about building a real time chat app using express and handlebars which imo was outdated technologies and it should've been taught with web sockets.

On top of these labs, you have a final project where you are tasked with building any website as long as you implement some sort of fairly complex features. The default project is building a fully functional Social Media web app that allows a user to perform all the CRUD operations along with dynamic profile pages, commenting, uploading images, search bar, sessions, and user email/password.

Overall though it was the most interesting class I took (albeit because I want to go into web dev) but  Professor Mariam Salloum was a wonderful and accommodating professor. It will be offered next Spring 2022 I think and I believe she will end up reforming the structure of the class better."	7	8/22/2021
		I came in with some web dev experience. I've worked with HTML, CSS, and JS before, but not with any frameworks. Anyway, if you're in a similar boat, this class will be tough. Would be much better if the course was split into 2 courses. Overall, there's just so much information, and such little time to master it. Many students left the class with little confidence in their web dev skills. You will definitely learn, but if you're just casually exploring web dev, I would consider taking another TE. This class ranks harder than CS111 and CS141 in my book. However, if you've worked with React, NodeJS, and MongoDB before, you should be okay.	10	9/18/2022
		I interned at SmartBot360 before taking this class and I’m pretty sure I learned a lot more from SmartBot360.	7	2/22/2023
		"Avoid this class at all cost if you have no experience in web development. This class is harder than 141 and 130 combined. You'll be given labs with a strict deadline and a project that is beyond a week's worth of work. Labs will continue until the end of the quarter, so if you struggle with labs, you'll have no time to work on the project. The project requires some knowledge from CS166 in which you're making a database.
If you're proficient in C++ and just that, this class will not be it for you. Participation is mandatory and you'll find yourself bored. Project is worth about 30%, quizzes are 25%, labs are 35%, and participation is 10%.
Find a good partner for the labs and your project group. Know how to use Github well because they'll grade your project based on that. DO NOT LET THE FIRST LAB FOOL YOU ON HOW EASY THIS CLASS IS.

There are easier TEs, avoid this class if you just want that easy TE credit. If you want to learn web development, literally learn it online or learn it at your local community college, you'll learn less in this class."	10	5/1/2023
CS111	7.88	Just study and put in the work. Utilize any and all resources your professor may give you, always, always go to office hours if you have any questions, and you should be fine.	7	3/31/2017
		The quizzes are your midterm and avoid Jeffrey McDaniel at all costs. He doesnt curve	9	3/31/2017
		Not too bad. Took it with Jeffrey McDaniel. I'm not sure if it was his attitude or the way he presented the material, but i understood what he was talking about. The topics covered arent too difficult to wrap your head around. RSA encryption, integer partitions, graph theory. Ocassionally he would not make sense for a bit. Notes are online. TA was helpful, prepared stuff presented in class, additional problems or whatever. Very math-y. Not really a CS course, pretty much an extension of Math011. Not too bad, easier than cs61 for sure lol	6	6/28/2017
		Took this with Jeffrey McDaniel; the class isn't hard but it is very punishing if you make mistakes in your work. Even if you had the right thought process and wrote the correct steps but ultimately messed up a small arithmetic error, you will get 0 points for the whole problem. The grading was 4 quizzes, 5 homeworks, and 1 final(400 pts quizzes, 200 pts homeworks, 400 pts final, no midterm) so you really have to be careful not to mess up on the quizzes. McDaniel liked to put some really weird numbers in his questions so that the problems ended up with monstrous quadratic formula roots that were annoying to tackle.	4	6/28/2017
		If you're terrible at math like myself and know it this will be one of the hardest courses you take almost on the level of Physics. Find yourself a good partner who can teach you the material and help you with the HW. You're going to need every resource the teacher gives you. Even during the Final review sessions with the professor there were people asking basic questions because honestly the lectures are just the professor proving the equations. Not many examples on how to use them. 	9	3/27/2018
		You need to put some effort to pass this class. The homework and exams can be relatively easy if you go to the lectures and discussions.	7	3/28/2018
		Avoid Elena Strzheletska. The cumulative grade was made up of 4 quizzes (10% each) , 5 homework (4% each) assignments and a final (40%). I think most people in my class can agree that she does a poor job at teaching the class. She speeds through the powerpoint, and changes homework questions the night before assigning them ( from last years hw questions ), leaving some problems very difficult to solve since she hasn't worked out the answers yet. For one homework assignment she even had to change a homework question 3 times because she didn't check the difficult of it beforehand. A lot of the hw questions are very vague and require meeting with a TA to understand how to solve. In terms of quizzes, she give a quiz 'syllabus' and 'sample' quizzes for each quiz, which is nice, but the material on the actual quizzes were very different than the sample ones. She actually gives quite a bit of extra credit for the quizzes though, so keep that in mind. Usually in class, she'll give you a timed ~5min problem than you can choose to answer for extra credit ( 1-2 points ) that gets added to the next quiz. At the end of the quarter she also give an extra credit quiz worth ~9 quiz points, if you can prove a few of the really challenging proofs she goes over through the course. In total, the amount of extra credit you could potentially get was close to 15 points which is 50% of a quiz grade ( out of 30 points normally ). The final was on the difficult side, with the average around 60% but she slightly curves it, so that the average is around 65/70%. Overall, prepare to spend a lot of time outside of the class on this course.   	9	12/14/2018
		Had Elena. She's decent as an instructor, but the quizzes were annoying as hell. You don't ever use the book, so the only resource for practice problems really is her lecture slides. But even then, she'll put problems on the quizzes that are more difficult/confusing than were on the lecture slides. 	8	12/18/2018
		Homework is graded strictly and the finals is super hard.	8	4/22/2019
		"Took with Elena. I was not used to proofs, so it was a rough ride in the beginning. I also had to miss every Friday lecture.

The tempo of the class was annoying. Each week, I was either stressing over the homework or a quiz. It can get pretty overwhelming at times. Lecture won't really teach you much. She basically just wants you to learn everything on your own. Attendance was taken irregularly during lecture and used as extra credit. Very rarely there would be a bonus problem at the end of lecture for a small extra credit.

You have enough time and resources for the homework. However, the quizzes might catch you off guard. Around half of the questions will be similar to the provided sample quizzes, but the last questions are going to be related to using proofs from lecture. If given the chance, do the homework before the quizzes. There were a number of times where the homework and quiz questions were near identical.

In the end, the material was not that bad, but the way it's presented to you can be confusing at times. "	8	6/11/2019
		Material in the course can be difficult, but if you spend the time to understand it by doing homework, practice problems, paying attention in lecture and discussion, you should be fine. If need be, go to office hours. I took it with Elena, even though I had heard she was difficult. I felt unimpressed. Even though her practice quizzes don’t look exactly like actual quizzes, quizzes never had unexpected material. If you don’t pay attention in class, and don’t do your part to understand material course will be much harder. I’m a CS major, but felt proofs required for the class were easy to understand. Only reason I put difficulty at a 7 was that I had to put in more work than normal, but Elena wasn’t the problem, was just the material covered. 	7	6/15/2019
		I had this class with Strzheletska. Here's the webpage for spring 2019: http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~elenas/CS111/cs111spr19.html. She can be pretty helpful in office hours, so be sure to go if you can.	6	6/15/2019
		Wasn't as bad as everyone said it was.  Ended up with a 77% overall but Elena gave me a B- after the curve.  I honestly slacked off at the beginning of the quarter and could have done better.  Just put in the time and you will do fine, Elena is a good person and willing to help her students out.	6	6/18/2019
		Class is really hard. You must really understand the homework assignments and you must read the book to pass this course. 	10	10/22/2019
		Took it with Elena. I honestly don't think this class is as bad as people make it seem. It definitely isn't easy but not impossible to pass. I agree the lectures aren't the most helpful but if you have any questions Elena is very helpful during office hours which she offers quite often. Quiz syllabi are very helpful in preparation for quizzes. If you just so happen to be taking a math class while taking this class I suggest asking your math TA for help on the hw rather than the TA's for this class (at least for the proofs, I don't think they can help with run times). Homework must be done in latex. If you study hard leading up to the quizzes (and not just the night before) you should do fine. Just don't slack off, this class really can be time consuming. Take every opportunity to earn extra points leading up to the final. I think what makes this course difficult is the amount of material covered. 	7	12/12/2019
		Took with Elena. The content isn't extremely difficult, but the format of the course is what's killer. There are 4 timed quizzes, 5 homeworks, and the final. The quizzes were doable; however,  I never felt as though we were given enough time considering the number of problems and amount of computation required. Homeworks are required to be done in Latex and weren't always straightforward, but there were definitely enough resources to complete them on time. Unfortunately, I was part of the quarter that had the online final, so all I have to say about that is it was overkill - part 1 had too many questions, there was too little time, and part 2 was too difficult to even attempt. Best of luck	8	3/18/2020
		"This class is as hard as you hear it is, and definitely the one I spent the most time on this quarter. 5 quizzes, 5 homeworks and ofc a final. The first quiz is basically a CS11 review and is ROUGH for everyone, as she basically expects you study for it by yourself. The only real concept that we use a lot from CS11 is induction and the score for this quiz can get replaced later. 
Make sure to start the homeworks as early as you can, USE HER OFFICE HOURS as they honestly helped me a ton. Do the problems on the quiz syllabuses and the practice quizzes, as they definitely help out. Elena is an alright lecturer, but be sure to pay attention as a lot of the material builds off each other. 
Our final was online cause of COVID-19, open note and on zoom, but pretty concept based. The average of our quiz scores was used to form 1 half off the final grade, pretty sick imo. 

Definitely can't slouch in this class."	8	3/27/2020
		"I took CS111 Summer 2020 with Elena. We had 3-hour sessions Mondays and Wednesdays mornings - Elena gave us 10 minute break about halfway.  For the summer, Elena gave out quizzes, worth 45% total. Quizzes were open note (no looking at slides). Final was closed-book and completely on graphs. Elena often gives us 5-10 to upload exam material to iLearn - hard if you’re uploading pictures.

Final grade was composed of grade on final exam and grade on quizzes. I highly recommend doing well on quizzes (80% or higher, if possible). Elena allowed us to replace bad scores on the quizzes with practice problems (similar to those we got wrong). After the final, Elena required us to state whether we cheated or not (submit pdf on Gradescope).Elena has a very strong, somewhat annoying, emphasis on cheating - to the point where it's very annoying.

Elena also almost always never posts the submission links for homework until you tell her to. For example, if homework is due Wednesday 11:59 pm and you don’t see the submission link at Tuesday 8 pm, email her to tell her to release the submission. 

"	8	8/5/2020
		Pretty difficult, but required. Elena usually teaches it and she's who I took it with. Make sure you study the material and you should do okay. DO NOT WASTE TIME PROCRASTINATING ON HOMEWORK. Seriously. I know plenty of students who waited until the last minute to do everything and got screwed.	8	11/17/2020
		Pretty difficult if you were to take it by yourself. Have a study group!	8	12/22/2020
		"Fuck this class and fuck Elena's inability to teach properly. Please take it with anyone but her. she won't even answer ur questions you ask her, she'll just say its easy and give a convoluted explanation that makes no sense. so you have to self learn and end up losing points on the hw because its not the ""right"" answer. For the winter 2021 final it was divided into two parts and part 2 could either cover all the material from the course (minus graphs which she just sped through and didn't cover properly at all) or it could be replaced with your quiz average. Part 1 is all graph theory and for the final she made it so damn difficult (10 questions mostly proofs and stuff we had never seen before). most students ended leaving multiple blank because she never taught us how to do these problems. she's admitted before she could never deal with timed quizzes and hard finals if she were in our shoes so idk why she structures it like this."	8	3/19/2021
		"Took it online with Chrobak. Homework grading was straight terrible, like ""arrive to the correct answer and get 2/10 for doing a different process"" terrible. Chrobak's lectures aren't worth attending, you can learn more from a 5 min Youtube video on each concept than listening to him. Office hours is worth it though. 

Final was absolutely killer, MUCH harder than any of the practice exams they gave us. The CS111 discord server had a poll and 34/34 voted that it was hard as fuck, not even a single troll vote saying that it was easy. "	8	3/19/2021
		The course material really isn't too bad. I had Marek Chrobak, and he was a professor with a good attitude. Just practice enough, and you're set. However, the grading distribution is what hurts students. Also, the final was split into 2 parts. First part was mandatory and only tests on graphs, but the second part is optional. If you don't take the part 2, it's your quiz average. If you do, it'll test you on the rest of the course material, but whatever you get (even if it's lower than the quiz average) is your grade on this portion. Each portion is 20% of your final grade. 4 quizzes = 40%, and 5 hw = 20%.	7	3/19/2021
		The quizzes are difficult because you have to complete them within 30 minutes. Make sure you spend a lot of time outside of class studying and take advantage of the office hours as much as possible. You have to know the material well in order to do well in the class. Try to get a high quiz and homework average since the final is very difficult and will bring down your grade quite a bit if you don't do well. 	8	3/22/2021
		Have to retake this class because Professor Chrobak refused to round my 58 to a 60 while rounding other peoples grades from a D+ to a C. Ridiculous expectations such as 30 minutes per quiz, final worth 40% of grade. Highly recommend taking this class in a lighter quarter with 2 other easy classes as you'll have more time to study.	10	3/23/2021
		The format of this class absolutely destroys you with the quizzes and homework, plus the final destroys everyone. Decent curve at the end that moves you up 1/3 - 2/3 of a letter grade up. You have to start of this class solid to even have a chance of getting a decent grade.	10	3/24/2021
		Took the class with Elena. Honestly not too bad. Make sure you know the content really well because what makes the class hard is the 30 minute quizzes. Read over the slides and really understand the material by doing extra practice problems. Go to every single office hours as she will help with the HW and give you extra practice questions for the quiz. The final was the hardest thing I've ever taken in my life with class was overall curved generously. 	7	3/25/2021
		I had Prof. Elena she is a great professor. she really wants you to understand the material. If you put in the time to truly understand the homework and do the practice quizzes she post you will be fine. The final was tough I dont think anyone in our class said it was easy. don't skip lectures it will hurt you and ask questions. Got a B in the class. there was like a 5-6% percent curve at the end.	7	3/29/2021
		Had this class with Chrobak. The examinations were extremely difficult and there was very little time on every quiz. Every test is a time scramble and time is probably one of the largest factors here. The homeworks are required to be written in LATEX which you have to learn at the beginning but is not too bad once you get the hang of it, just time consuming. However do be warned, the grading was extremely non transparent. A grade shift curve was applied at the end but however was not released so students did not know how much their grades got shifted if at all and emails to the professor asking about the general curve were not answered. Basically, watch your time during quizzes tests and know proofs. This class has many proofs in the lectures and in the final. There were a total of 4 quizzes total and a 2 part final, the 2nd part of the final being optional (If you didn't take, the average of your quizzes were the score used for the second part of the final). The averages for the quizzes in our class were 74.4%, 71.3%, 80%, and 71.5% and the finals were 61.73%(part 1) and 67.92% (part 2) and the homework average across 5 assignments were 88.29%.  (After regrades, the averages are probably slightly higher) Asking many students about their grades after the curved, I could be totally off but I would give an estimated guess of about a 3-6% curve to your final grade.	9	5/22/2021
		"Took Chrobak in Spring 2021. No matter if you choose Chrobak or Elena (who is the head professor), you will have a hard time. 
Lectures are heavily dense with explanations on the mathematical proofs behind why a certain theorem exists, which aren't utilized for the homework or exams at all, at least for this quarter. It is unironically a better experience watching Khan Academy or Numberphile on YouTube than attending lecture. ACR tutoring for this class filled up extremely fast too, so good luck getting any outside tutoring. The final only focused on graphs and was worth 30% of the grade.
Final for BOTH sections were moved to the earlier scheduled final, which opens up the risk for time conflicts. The final was also only 2 hours instead of 3 hours. Grades released within TWO days of taking the final, which created grading errors. Average on the final across both sections was a 57%. However, because the maximum was a 93.8%, that was the curve that was used, so it didn't impact much. 
Survey was taken for this class. 50% were expecting to fail the final, 48% hated the decision to move the final earlier, 81% felt that 2 hours wasn't enough, 67% felt sample materials weren't sufficient enough to study for the final, 67% said the final was harder than expected, and 90% were in favor of a steeper curve.
Future classes that require this class as a prerequisite only require a D-, keep that in mind before dropping early -- it will still screw with your GPA though"	10	6/10/2021
		Took with Elena Summer 2019. Of course its tough but I actually liked her teaching. Maybe there's something wrong with me idk. I sat near the front and never tried to joke around and asked a question every now and then and she went super easy on me, she gave me a hint for one of the questions during the final bc she saw me struggling on it. I guess the secret is to be kind of a suckup without being annoying.	7	11/7/2021
		Everything is graded like its an exam, be careful.	8	12/10/2021
		So I had to retake this class so I took it with Elena as she was the only one teaching at the time. The lectures weren't particularly helpful tbh. For the quizzes, the mock quizzes she gave a few days before the quiz were more helpful than the google drive ones. She also gave 40 mins a quiz vs 30 mins when I took it the first time with chrobak so that definitely helped me a lot. I would spend around 3 days studying for the quizzes, 1 day to work through google drive samples, 1 day to time myself on the mock quiz, and another to go through lecture problems. This is really necessary as the final was all on graphs and since its worth 35% it can bring your grade down harshly. The average on the final was around a 50% so my grade dropped from a b- to a c- but then she pulled some magic at the end and I ended with a b-	5	1/4/2022
		Took with elena, dont slack, go over slides and do problems, have a study group, do any practice quizzes she gives out, make sure to try all the hw problems yourself. Tough but not bad.	7	2/8/2022
		took it with Chrobak, think he did fine as a professor, his accent was kinda heavy so it was hard to get what he was talking about but what are you gonna do about that, I think he gave a pretty good amount of resources to do pretty much everything in the class, from his slides, to formatted lecture notes, lecture recordings, recorded discussions, and practice quizzes. His midterm and final pretty much cover everything youd done in the hw and quizzes. WATCH OUT FOR THE QUIZZES the biggest grade killer imo, you get like no time to do them so if you cant snap out a question immediately its pretty much over for that question killed by grade and got me a D+ even with a cruve. The hw is also kinda weird like i would get marked off for not showing something even though i thought i showed it enough but overall it fine, tedious cause he makes you format it into latex, but fine.  	9	6/19/2022
		I took this class twice with Elena. I failed the first time. The second time around I made an active effort to ask questions and go to office hours. Alot of people think Elena is like from the depths of hell, ya she's strict but she really does care. And she will notice the effort you make. Attendance isn't mandatory but she loves to threaten the class if people don't show up to class. If you go to lecture you'll see a lot of parallels between HW problems and the lecture examples, same with discussion. Usually 5 homeworks, no midterm, 4-5 quizzes, and final. Do the practice quizzes. I cannot stress this enough, the quizzes are pretty much structured the same as the quiz and it's good practice. Final was hard af, on graphs. I failed it but hey we still passed boys its ok. The class is not programming heavy, except for 1 HW. The class is challenging but it's doable.  Don't cheat, don't bother trying, they will catch you. And, there usually is a curve at the end and sometimes she offers EC, and 60% or higher is passing.	8	9/26/2022
		I took this class back during spring quarter of 2022 with Chrobak when remote learning was still an option and it was very difficult to stay focused during the lecture. The homework has unrealistic expectations when it comes to grading as it may be impossible to get a good score on and the worst part is that the homework may save or ruin your grade. Quizzes worth 40% with a constraint of 30 minutes or less to solve rigorous problems that were either on the homework or lecture. I barely crawled out of this class alive academically thanks to the homeworks. 141 is like this class except it has a more balanced approach to the grading scale. I wouldn’t take this class again.	10	11/19/2022
		Very difficult class, took it with Chrobak. The key to surviving is to, and this is much easier with a study group, go over and fully understand each of the hw and every single problem on the practice quizzes given out beforehand. Don't overthink the theory, just memorize how to solve each problem, most topics/problems can be solved like puzzles if u just memorize a tutorial. Homeworks are graded like exams for accuracy, don't make mistakes. Overexplain on proofs during quizzes, I've gotten lots of points docked off on proofs just for missing key terminology or math symbols.	9	12/25/2022
		Took with Elena. Hard class but doable. 20% for hw and 50% for quizzes and we had 6 with 1 dropped. I dont think shes as bad as people say she is but shes not amazing either. She also tries to scare students into thinking they should drop the class early if they dont know a few things that they wont even need after week 2. Just go to class and pay attention. If you dose off for a slide, youll most likely be lost for the rest of lecture. Utilize discussion bc she has good examples that will be on the quiz or on the hw. And dont worry if u dont do good on the first quiz, the rest of them are a lot easier imo.	8	3/17/2023
CS120A	See EE120A			
CS120B	See EE120B			
CS122A	4.33	Took it with Frank Vahid in Fall 2020. It's the continuation of CS120A and CS120B Just with more advanced topics and assignments. It's honestly just do the Zybooks every week. The final project was to make something that you felt was as hard you could do. Some people went above and beyond and implemented a PID controller on a microchip, but some people went really easy on themselves and just designed a basic state machine with the built in Zybooks state machine builder. 	4	11/7/2021
		Took with Vahid. Basically CS120B part 2! We made 2 projects with Arduinos. The course content is also pretty cool! To ace the midterm + final, you have to attend class. I would love to take this class again! 10/10 in quality!	5	9/18/2022
		Taken with Frank Vahid, pretty easy but slightly time consuming, if you enjoyed the labs of CS120B you'll be fine with this class. Its mostly 2 projects that you think of yourself, each project is supposed to take ~30 hours each to complete, so dont leave it to last minute and youll be fine	4	10/31/2022
CS130	8.27	Computer Graphics with Tamar Shinar. The class is definitely difficult. It's a fair mix of programming and concept. There are two major projects, a ray tracer and graphics pipeline that each take about half the quarter to complete. There was one midterm and one final. The average on the exams was around a 70% for our class, which she said was a little on the higher side. 50% is a B and 75% is an A on the exams. To prepare for the exams, make sure to use the practice ones posted on her site. Make sure to utilize the textbook as well. The labs were manageable, and sometimes provided hints toward the projects. It was a difficult class but definitely rewarding and I learned quite a bit.	9	3/23/2018
		If you take it with Craig. The test are hard. Trying taking it with Tara. Projects are a lot of work but doable	9	12/15/2018
		Took it with craig, two projects worth 60%, each has 10% bonus, so if you do well on project then you are fine. C++ coding for the project and it's not easy unless you have understood all the material.  Exam is hard but it has curve. I aced the project and got 68% on midterm and 40% on final and final grade is A.	8	1/7/2019
		"I took this with Tamar Shinar and I heard Craig Schroeder is way harder so consider that before taking the class. 
For the grading scale: 15% midterm, 20% final, 15% checkpoints, 15% project1, 15% project 2, 20% weekly labs (literally every week). The class itself was actually really time consuming. The projects could take upwards of 3-4 days to finish. The first is a ray tracer and the second is a pipeline. Average for the final and midterm (post-curve) were around 76-80% so the tests are alright but the projects will really hurt you."	9	3/31/2019
		"If you had dreams as a kid to make games, that it would be fun, that you would be programming game mechanics, then this is NOT your class. This class is more about how the visuals in games/3D animated movies/Simulations work.

You'll be mostly doing math the entire semester. If you enjoyed and did very well in Physics then this is you class. This class is mostly implementing those things you learned in physics in order to reproduce how an eye see light hit objects and back in order for a game to see the scene. 

There is are two projects due during the semester and several labs to do as well. A lot of the time the labs seem to go far off tangent from what we are doing in the project. There was literally several people in my lab complaining to the Graduate Lab Instructor that what we were doing was nothing to do with Graphics and still very obscure hard to do.

For the project you'll be given skeleton code and you're going to have to implement several algorithms and parts to get the graphics tool to work. The skeleton code is pretty high up there to understand. You really need to consider yourself a C++ programmer in order to understand what's going on and how to use some of it.   

If you just want to have fun actually making a game either try the VR course CS 135 or join GameSpawn. CS 130 is more behind the scenes stuff of how visuals are handled by the GPU."	9	12/17/2019
		Took with Tamar and I recommend you to do the same. She is extremely helpful when it comes to the projects/labs and general understanding of the course content. There were two projects, weekly labs, a midterm and a final. The projects require a considerable amount of time to complete, but they are more than doable. I'd say the most difficult part of the class, at least for me, was the labs or those in the second half of the course with opengl. I had zero experience using it, and still feel that I don't have any grasp on it. The midterm and final are straightforward if you paid attention in lecture and carefully implemented the projects. Also, the class is pretty heavily curved. Overall your experience in this class will depend largely on your lab ta, so choose wisely. I suggest Kristian Tram if he's available - super helpful	6	3/18/2020
		Took with Tamar Shinar. You need to understand the lectures and the skeleton code before you can do anything. Ray Tracer was definitely easier than the Pipeline. Brush up on your C++ because I was pretty rusty coming into this class. The labs aren't too bad; you could probably get them most of them done within the lab time if you focus and ask questions. Jason Goulding was a very helpful TA as well. The exams were T/F and multiple choice problem solving from the lecture. 	7	3/27/2021
		Math-heavy class. Review multi-variable call, vectors, matrices, etc. Lots of in-class derivations of things. Learn the content and understand it thoroughly because the exams are more about applying how to derive something than the actual formulas. Labs and projects are a pain, but pretty cool.	8	12/10/2021
		"Took with Craig. It appears that he really has improved his teaching style for the course over the years. If you want to get ahead, you can find Craig's material from previous CS130 courses on his site (just google ""Craig Schroeder""). The course requires adaptation around week 3. More of the course relies on your linear algebra savvy rather than programming knowledge (although both are required). Overall, the topics are very interesting, and it's a different change of pace from most CS courses. But it will be challenging, so make sure to study up and put in the work. Specifically focus on Ray Tracing, Phong Shader, Graphics Pipeline, and perspective transforms."	8	12/10/2021
		This class brought me so much pain in a single quarter. Took with Craig Schroeder. He's a great guy and he's definitely passionate about everything he teaches. All of his notes are on previous websites but man, they are HORRIBLE. If you don't go to lecture and try to depend on those, you're not gonna have a good time. You can resort to using the textbook but even that might not feel like enough sometimes. For the midterm, it was not bad because he basically took questions similar to previous quarters and used those. The final though was a different story. Most of the class studied previous finals because he said it was the best way to study. That was not enough. Programming assignments were basically taking mathematical concepts and translating it into C++. If you aren't the best with C++ you will have a hard time. The department removed the lab section for this class so it definitely made the homeworks a lot harder than what they used to I think. This class will have you crying tears of joy for being able to make a png with a circle on it. Best of luck for anyone taking this class.	9	12/21/2022
		Taken in Winter 2023 with Craig Schroeder. Before the first homework assignment was even graded, half the class had already dropped. The class was difficult with all of the math that you had to learn to finish the homework assignments (they used to be labs, but the school had removed lab section from this course for some reason). The removal of lab sections hurt because the stuff you end up coding in the homework is just math concepts turned into C++, so it would've been great to get help from the TA. Definitely go to class as often as you can since his slides are absolutely worthless most of the time. Midterm and Final are difficult, even if you study previous year's exams.	9	3/27/2023
CS135	6.71	This class is very interesting in itself. The exams are hard but expect a hard curve. Do the extra credit in the labs since they boost your grade by a lot. Also the labs will take a while to do since you need to be both coding and modeling at the same time.	6	8/29/2018
		The VR course is not as difficult as people make it out to be. There maybe comes one point in which the labs become difficult but everything can be done through Google and they encourage the use of it. That being said the lectures and lab feel so disjointed. The lectures seem to be more about how the hardware makers created VR and how the device handles movement and creating the VR scene. The lab on the other hand is just game dev stuff and for the most part never deal with the lectures. That being said there isn't any HW on the lectures so you're never quite sure if you understand the subject until midterm and finals come and you have to do the rotation calculations. That being said you can use a cheat sheet and that makes the subject less difficult. The professor is really nice. Def the best professor at BCOE, not intimidating and  knowledgeable. You won't have anywhere near the pain that CS61 and CS111 bring taking this course.	7	12/14/2018
		"VR. Professor Chen. Good professor. Passionate about the subject and an interesting class. I'd say the course isn't difficult per say but the exams can be tricky. The labs are working with unity and such and the last 3 weeks are a project so make sure you get a good grasp on the content presented in lab. If you ever took cs130 graphics this class is similar, working with quaternions and stuff ""model view matrix"" and ""viewing frustum"" and such. Kind of a mathy class. Professor uploads example midterms/final and they're pretty similar so study those."	7	3/24/2019
		"VR class. the labs are basically just Unity gamemaking for the Oculus while the lectures are different calculations related to physics, light, head movement, eye movement, audio cues, things like the vestibular ocular reflex / accommodation & converge mismatch, etc. kind of a weird class to be honest but it wasn't too hard. definitely not an easy A class but it's pretty hard to fail. the average for the first midterm was like a B- and the second was a C or C-. 
be warned, there is a final project that's worth 30% that you have to demo during finals week. it's rather tedious but if you have a good group it should be ok. all labs and the final project are done in groups."	8	3/31/2019
		Jiasi Chen is super chill, awesome, and a great teacher. This is an overall fun/interesting class and the exams are practical. But prepared to get wrecked if you can't use Unity during the labs.	7	12/25/2020
		Since everything is online (Winter 2021), the two midterms are open book, so the multiple choice and true/false questions are easy to find. The free response problems can range in difficulty, but share similar concepts from the previous midterms she gives us for practice. Labs are in unity, but we don't have VR so it's just game dev. Final project can be anything in Unity, make sure the final report is well written though. My class was curved and I ended up with an A- despite having an 85%. Also the professor is pretty cute. 	5	3/29/2021
CS141	8.38	The curve was huge at the end lul	9	4/1/2017
		Ok, so most of the time, you have no idea what you are doing or what is going on. I took this class with Professor Stefano Lonardi. I think he is a good teacher, it's just this is a difficult class. A friend took this class before, dropped out halfway through because he failed his midterm. He retook it with me, and said he prefers Stefano to his old teacher, as he explains clearly and uses lecture notes/slides to his advantage. Do not underestimate this class though. The average on both midterms was a 62%. Stefano does curve, he drops lowest scoring question on both the midterms and the final. The midterms were 4 questions/25 points each, the final was 10 questions/10 points each. The class itself is curved, the A range is 100-80%, B is 70-79.9%, C is 60-69.9%.. etc. So you are given that 10% grace. This is the first 'hard' cs class usually taken by undergraduates, at least for me, and it's a tough one. Do not underestimate it.	9	12/13/2017
		Not going to lie - this class is probably the most difficult one I have ever taken (haven't taken 152 or 153 yet). It covers algorithm runtimes, Divide & Conquer (pretty hard) Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming (the hard part), and Weighted Graphs. I only passed from the curve. If you can take it with Lonardi, do it. He's a great professor.	9	12/22/2017
		Home gradually gets harder and harder, peaking in difficulty on dynamic programing. My biggest regret is not doing more examples and asking more questions. Also, there was a huge curve and nearly half the class got A's	8	12/27/2017
		Try to take it with Lonardi, such a great professor. Grades very fairly, accepts regrade requests, large curve on the grades. 	8	12/27/2017
		Took it with Professor Stefano Lonardi. I highly, highly recommend taking it with him. He is super friendly, approachable, passionate and has a great lecturing style that makes this difficult course a little more manageable. I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures, though be warned he does have an Italian accent that may occasionally be a little difficult to understand(he says algorit instead of algorithm, for example). Average for midterm in this class was 50/100.	10	6/19/2018
		pray for curve lol	8	12/15/2018
		Took it with Amr, the class is not easy be prepared to study a lot. 	8	12/18/2018
		Took this class with Ahmed Eldawy. Honestly, this class was pretty difficult for me. In the beginning, you're dealing with Master Theorem, which isn't too hard once you study it and understand it completely. But, once you start touching upon Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming is when the class really starts to feel really difficult. You must study the material as soon as you can; otherwise, you'll feel really left behind, and it will result in you not knowing what the hell you're writing about on your quizzes and/or homework assignments. After Greedy and DP, you deal with shortest path algorithms, which weren't super difficult, but still left an impact on you. Overall, CS141 is probably one of the hardest upper-division CS courses you'll ever take. It's not easy to get an A in this class; you'll be happy with a C, and you'll know exactly why.	9	3/25/2019
		"Took this class with Ahmed Eldawy. Honestly, I thought I would have to work really hard to pass this class but instead ended with an A-. The material is relatively difficult but as long as you study all the ""prime"" examples for each topic then you can score decently well on the exams. Just make sure you get above the class avg for all your exams and do all your hws."	8	3/27/2019
		"Provided you do well enough on the homework, you should do alright in the class. There's a HUGE curve at the end (if you take it with Eldawy) and it brought my D- to a C+. Ask for extra credit, and thou will receive. There are a few in-class activities that factor into your grade, but not much. The best advice I've seen for this class was written on the walls in ACM this past quarter: ""try your best and ride the curve""."	7	3/29/2019
		Are you ready to get jeffed? His lecture is actually not that bad, but the final is way harder than his lecture. 	7	5/25/2019
		"Took it with Lonardi. Lonardi is a good professor. Homeworks are hard, I had to cave in and get a chegg subscription to answer some problems because getting as many points as possibly is crucial in this course. Homeworks are similar to CS111 in the sense that it may ask you to apply a concept to answer a problem that doesn't have examples available to study from. That in mind, pay attention to homework and study the solutions because some showed up on the exam with some changes. Exam questions are hard, but easier than the homework IMO. Didn't mean I did good though cause I couldn't do the majority of hw problems without online help. You'll need to know the pseudocode for the algorithms in the slides because a couple will show up on the exam, in the sense that you need to write down the exact pseudocode or will have to use it as a part of your answer. There might be one or two really easy questions, but they'll be easy if you remember what its asking for like recurrence relations/master theorem/drawing huffman tree. Lectures are useful especially for greedy and dynamic programming, please don't skip for those or the slides won't make any sense. Plenty of people that skipped had issues with these. Only lectures I would recommend skipping are the first one(just talks about big O) and the last couple ones since what you need to know are pseudocodes for the graph algorithms.

TLDR: Its a hard class. Exams and homework are hard. Exams get curved. Lectures are great, helps with understanding the info the majority of the time. Still, even if its a terrible experience you'll learn quite a lot concepts for interview questions. Also grading scale is 10% lowered. I.e A = 80-100%, B = 70-80%...D=50-60% so on and so forth. Haven't gotten my grade yet so I don't know if there is more curving."	8	6/15/2019
		This class was really difficult. The homeworks took several hours per problem in general, although I'm sure some people turned to the internet for the solutions. Those same people do terribly on the exams, so don't bother, force yourself to work on the homework alone, start the day it is assigned, and you will do OK. Always study the material before/after class, it will make much more sense.	9	6/15/2019
		I took this course with professor Lonardi. Lonardi makes sure you get the material and is very forgiving in how he grades. He gives out practice exams for all exams except the final. The practice exams are not exactly similar, but the material in them is similar. The homework assignments due every week was a bit difficult. 	7	6/17/2019
		Took with Amr Magdy. Make sure you do well on the homework. All the answers are online. Also his tests aren’t hard and are not meant to trick you. Just make sure you review classic examples through YouTube and you will be prepared for his class. Also he curves FAT	7	12/14/2019
		I'm going to be real. CS111 was hard asf but this class was fairly easy. I took this course with Amr. Don't get me wrong, please study ALOT! The average for test were C's and D's.My friends scored around C's and D's and studied a lot. 	10	12/14/2019
		Let's just say I was surprised I passed the class. I was mentally prepared to retake it but I passed. So trust the curve. Took it with Amr.	10	12/16/2019
		Took this with Lonardi, got an A+. Lonardi is an amazing teacher and you'll have to make the effort to go to class because the lectures help out a lot. He also makes sure everybody understands what's going on and is willing to repeat the concept again if you ask. The homeworks are a lot harder than the exams, so don't stress out too much but take the time to learn the material. He dropped the lowest question for the exams.	5	12/30/2019
		This is the one CS course that is infamous for its difficulty. Even the professors I had kept reiterating how it was the most difficult undergrad CS course at UCR. Be prepared for fast paced lectures that are more abstract than concrete and little time to grasp major concepts. Though I feel if you did great in CS 111, you should have a leg up in this class.	7	12/30/2020
		Took 141 with Eldawy. He's a great professor who teaches really well. The concepts in this class are fairly difficult to wrap your head around. A solid foundation of DS&A from CS014 (CS010C) is required to do well in this class.	8	3/21/2021
		Extremely hard, I gave CS111 a 10/10 rating and if there was an option for 12/10 in this database I would give it one lmao. This class made 111 look like an average difficulty class, this class is so heavy on proofs and concepts (sometimes you just gotta take the L and make up random stuff out of thin air and put in on your paper). CS141 with Elena was brutal but honestly she's not as bad as people say, it's just the class structure and material tbh.	10	6/2/2021
		Probably the hardest computer science course I've taken so far. It's not easy and you will need to be ready to spend hours outside of class looking up other resources if you want to pass. Have a good understanding of Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis going into this class.	9	6/15/2021
		Took it with Amey and the whole time I was questioning whether I would pass or not but he came with a fat curve in the end. Study the study guide and examples to pass the class. Try to get average or above the average to get B and higher. Also he's very understanding with the whole class as its in pandemic so he push back deadline for a bit. Trust the process. 	9	6/15/2021
		Genuinely the hardest class I have ever taken. Foremost, I took this class with Amey in spring 2021, rated it a 10/10 difficulty, and received a B grade by some miracle of god. This class is significantly more difficult than cs111; to pass this class you will need to have a solid study schedule. I watched every lecture 3 times since it was an online class. The real challenge of this class is that every problem is nothing like any problem you have ever seen; every question is completely unique and you must rely on basic principles to figure out an optimal solution. Midterms that were 20% of your grade often only had 2 problems, each question being 10% of your grade. So you MUST get them correct. The curve was probably around 30% at the end I would bet.	10	6/15/2021
		Took this class with Fuad Jamour over summer 2021, PLEASE take it with him if you can or take it over summer. I probably wouldve failed it if I took it during the school year tbh. the class was so damn hard, but most of the hw/test questions are already from code that is online so that makes things a bit easier.	9	9/1/2021
		Took this class with Yan Gu in Fall 2021 and honestly he is a GOAT. Class itself is hard but I found it easier and more interesting than CS111. For his class you have to do Homework assignments and Programming assignments, but others only have HW. They may or may not be a curve, but for there was and the class average grade was an A-. If you take Gu or Yihan, it will definitely prepare you more for coding interviews than other professors. This is coming from someone who got a C+ in CS111 with Elena. I suggest getting a head start on Dynamic Programming since that is hardest concept to grasp for most students. 	8	12/7/2021
		I took Elena and got a B, the class ranges from difficulty(Also the class is composed of only quizzes) This is How I studied for the course. Do all the Homework, do the practice quiz's, do the old practice quizzes she provides, and go to office hours and ask for help whenever you need it. The material is inherently difficult but what CS class aren't, her quizzes from when I was taking her were similar to her practice quizzes and homework so if you do what I said you should be fine. 	8	2/7/2022
		I took it with Ahmed Eldawy Winter 2022. I think of all the professors who teach this class, he is definitely the easiest. 3 midterms, 5 hws, 1 final project. Even gives us two days of late passes to use without penalty on the hws. The only thing I wish could've been improved is being able to have open notes for the exams :(	9	3/22/2022
		Took this class with Amey during Spring 2022. Class is hard. Go to office hours for help. Hw 30%, Quiz 10%, Midterms 50%, final presentation 10%. Make sure to understand what each algorithm is used for and learn how to explain proofs to get full points. Also include runtime when you can.	9	6/15/2022
		Try and take it when Luta(Yuta) isn't the TA, most useless TA i have ever had. He ruined my computer science experience for me at this school	9	12/18/2022
		"Professor Yan and Yihan will do everything they can to make sure you pass. They care more about you learning algorithms than the content of your grade and they know that by the extra credit they consistently give out throughout the class. The professors will also give out prizes at the end of the quarter if you're really interested in algorithms and done their extra credit assignments whether that be some candy or a brand new hard drive. The programming assignments they have are good practice and may save you from failing if you don't do well on the homeworks. You can turn in late homeworks and assignments but that will use a 'late day' similar to a point system in which you're at default 4 for my class. My recommendation is to start early on the homeworks because you will need that time to proof read your work. Upon learning greedy proofs and DP those are the main topics to focus on if you want to pass the midterm, especially on DP as it can be quite confusing at first but if you go to the professors office hours they will explain it clearly enough to understand. As someone that got a 'D' in CS 111 and heard this was like the sequel class, I thought I wouldn't do well in this class, and I was wrong.
The class average was an 'A' at the end."	3	12/25/2022
		Took this class with Yan Gu and Yihan Sun in Fall 2022. The class is essentially combined together and you could attend either one of their lectures as they keep the same pace. They are really friendly and super helpful with any problems encountered. It was a bit more challenging than previous iterations as they decided to add mandatory programming assignments in the class. Although they offered ample extra credit and multiple bonus problems I only did a few of them. I was on time on my assignments and spent most of the quarter on this class. Somehow made it out with an A	8	1/12/2023
		Wanted to kms after calculating my final grades, but push through to the end because the curve is prettyyyy preetttyyyy good. Possibly the most difficult course you will take in your whole undergraduate CS career. Do not wait until the last day to do assignments, you will regret it every time!!!!!	8	3/29/2023
CS142	8.00	[Algorithm Engineering] This is basically the coding part of CS141. Teaches you more about different ways to solve problems, as well as some parallelism, where you actually implement it. There is a HW assignment every week, where it rotates between codeforces, latex, and said parallelism. We had 2 quizzes and no final. So if you liked CS141 and want more, this is the class for you.	8	3/23/2023
CS144	7.00	[Bioinformatics for CS] Taken with Lonardi. I did not care about the biology aspects of it, but the algorithms were interesting. The topics make sense, such as string pattern matching and tree construction. The first homework is pure biology, and the second is the hardest homework in the class. All other homeworks are not too difficult. There are no exams, but there is a final project, where you choose one topic out of 10. This is an algorithms class, that uses dynamic programming. If you did not do well is CS 141, I think it might be more difficult than I thought it was.	6	5/24/2022
CS147	3.00	"This class with Daniel Wong is LIT! He teaches every spring quarter. 
Summary: 2 Midterms, 1 final project, 4 assignments (coding assignments, but there are less than 50 lines of code per assignment IF that). 
Daniel Wong is GOAT'd, he's very empathetic and cares about his student and is very aware of other courses being in a student's agenda, therefore he makes his class very manageable. (This is coming from someone who took 4 Upper-Div CS Classes while taking this class). Exams were super fair, he does curve if your midterm grades are really bad, OR he will replace your bad midterm with the updated grade of 2nd midterm (if you score higher than you did on your first midterm). Overall, very easy and manageable class!

DO GO TO CLASS THO, he does upload lecture videos, but does stop uploading if he sees lot less people attending lecture."	3	6/3/2023
CS150	6.25	Took it with Tao Jiang. He's very passionate about this subject and you can tell by the way he lectures. There's one midterm and one final. The class is entirely composed of homeworks, midterm and final, no lab or project points. The tests are very fair, questions from the homework that you should be expected to know. The class itself is tough, but imo not as tough as 141. Make sure you understand each topic, as each builds off of each other. The homework is a good gauge on how well you know the material. No programming in this class, exams and homework are done in pencil and paper. Difficult, but manageable.	8	3/23/2018
		Had Tao Jiang. Class was difficult. The tests were fair though, since they're similar to homework problems as well as the sample problems he gives during the lectures before exams. There's only the final, the midterm, and the homework, but homework was worth 30% of the grade, and he gives over a week to do them, so you should be working on them seriously as they're an indicator of whether or not you'll be prepared for the exam as well as easy points for your grade.	8	3/26/2018
		Took it with Tao Jiang. Inductions can be hard to follow, but as long as you can do examples, you should be fine.	6	3/29/2018
		Took it with Tao. Make sure to understand the homework and don't skip the discussions, midterms and final are similar to homework and discussion examples.	5	6/15/2018
		Like many others, I took it with Tao Jiang. The class is very easy if you make sure you don't fall behind at ANY point in the content. If you did poorly on a particular section in the midterm or on homeworks, you MUST figure out what you did wrong to succeed in this course because the content builds on each other really fast. So, if your foundation is shaky you will have a terrible time in this course. It is easy in the sense that it's very straightforward: if you do well on homeworks, you WILL do well on midterms. The questions are extremely similar. 	7	6/19/2018
		"Took this class with Paea LePendu. Honestly, this class wasn't that difficult. It's ""automata and formal languages""; in this class, you learn about push-down automata and the many formal languages from regular languages to context-free languages to decidable languages to recognizable languages. If you're familiar with state machines, this class will feel similar, but not exactly. LePendu is passionate about this subject, and doesn't want anyone to not pass; he gives out extra credit opportunities on the homeworks, occasional quizzes, and on the tests. You'll still need to work hard in this class. At first, it'll feel a little intimidating, but over time, you'll realize that this class isn't that hard at all especially when taught by LePendu."	4	3/25/2019
		Taught by Tao Jiang. He is really good. Attend every class, as this class builds upon itself basically every lecture. Study the notation, as that can be a big roadblock to understanding the ideas. And make sure you have a solid understanding of induction. Very interesting and fun.	7	6/15/2019
		Took this class with Lependu and got A+. Super easy; if you do the homework, you'll do well on the midterms. If you do well on the midterms, you'll do well on the final. It's super straightforward and I didn't even do any of the reading. A tip is to not overthink, and you'll realize that it's easier than it seems.	3	12/30/2019
		I finished the class and still have no idea what/how any of it benefits my future career lol. This class is confusing, difficult to understand, and what’s worse is that the lectures are a bore. Discussions, on the other hand, is EXTREMELY HELPFUL. I repeat, EXTREMELY HELPFUL. Watch/go to discussion session before you attempt homework! 	10	12/28/2020
		Took with Tao Jiang (Remote). The theory can be hard to follow and the lectures are very abstract, to the point where I didn't find them very useful. This is a class I found doable, but had to put a fair amount of time into. Class has a built in curve of about 10% (85 is an A, 80% is A-). Homeworks areworth 8% each, so make sure you do a good job on them as every point will make a difference if you're aiming for an A. My best advice would be to get as many points you can on the homework, and then find similar practice problems for the midterm/final. Do this and you should be solid.	7	1/3/2021
		Take with Lependu, he genuinely cares about you and your grade and wants everyone to succeed. 40% of grade based on homeworks and he guides you thru the homework problems if you need help. Really nice and caring professor, made it an easy class	6	3/25/2021
		Took with Tao Jiang, Spring 21. It's not bad if you study ahead. It builds off a lot of topics covered in CS111, so get ready for a decent amount of proofs. This class is very theory-heavy. The class can be broken down into sections: 1.DFA/NFA, 2. Regexes, 3. Pumping Lemma, 4. CFG's/PDA's, 5. CFL Pumping Lemma. Expose yourself to these topics ahead of time to save yourself a lot of trouble. Definitely manageable. The HW is the key to success.	7	6/9/2021
		Took it with Lependu Spring 2022 as a technical elective for CSBA, probably one of the most miserable experiences of my life. No zoom option, no homework solutions, no practice exams. For some reason the content was really hard for me, but that just might be a me problem. He did allow us to make test corrections on the 1st midterm which i was very grateful for, never had any professor do that. And he made the final exam optional as well. I ended with a B despite getting Cs on the exams and all the extra credit we got. 	7	12/18/2022
		Legends was lit, take him, he’s an amazing lecturer and his TAs are always super helpful! The course itself wasn’t hard conceptually but studying I key to passing lependu exams, they’re all super fair tests	5	1/13/2023
		Course materials are not hard to understand if you attend lectures. LePendu explains concepts clearly. Homework are not hard with the help from TA. Exams are easy because professor goes over past midterms for reviews, exam questions are similar to those past midterms. Take LePendu if possible.	4	3/14/2023
CS152	7.21	Take this class (compilers) after taking automata 	5	2/12/2019
		avoid song. Just good advice in general. Any class you take with song will be terrible. Song is a terrible professor regardless of class content. I have no idea what this class was really about. Its kind of like an extension of cs150 so if you could handle that class this one shouldn't be too bad.	9	3/24/2019
		Song is the worst professor. The fact that only 25% of the students shows that his lectures are boring and you probably learn more by reading the slides yourself. The lab is terrible. You have to build a compiler from scratch and there is not enough resources on how to do it, especially phase 3, which is 25% of the whole grade. Absolutely one of the most difficult CS classes I have ever taken.	10	6/15/2019
		Took this with Zhijia Zhao. The tests weren't too bad if you studied the homework and the practice problems he provided. First two phases of the project were basically a joke and could easily be done in a day. The third one's definitely much more challenging and you should start early on that one.	7	12/12/2019
		Took this class with Gupta, Winter 2020, good guy. The material was hard but his slides are very to-the-point for exams. As expected, phases 1 and 2 of the project were chill but phase 3 was the hardest. If you didn't finish phase 3, you get 70% if it compiles properly with no errors. The end of winter 2020 was when shit hit the fan with COVID-19, so the final he made take-home, but still difficult imo. Midterm was chill. Gupta typically gives a VERY generous curve at the end, but don't take this class lightly, definitely put aside time for this class, especially the project.	7	6/23/2020
		Gupta, Winter 2021. The previous review still holds up. Slides are straightforward for the exams so learn the examples well. Lecture content is dense. Final is non-cumulative. Phase 1 and 2 could be done in a single day if you wanted to. For Phase 3, they give you a good example in the slides that's completed in C++. You can choose to complete Phase 3 in C++ or C, but you need to take extra steps to implement in C++. There's some good info about that on stackoverflow and the bison documentation. You will get at least 70/100 points on Phase 3 if you implement enough stuff, so even if it doesn't pass the test cases, you should be fine if the implementation makes sense. It also has to compile on the bolt server without errors or else you will get a 0; they won't fix your makefile for you. Overall, the class isn't too stressful until you reach those last couple of weeks with phase 3. 	7	3/27/2021
		Took this class online with prof Gupta, first half of the class plus the midterm is fairly easy. The second half is pretty tough in the sense that there are a few real examples you can practice for the final. But prof was really accessible for asking questions.  Most of the project is pretty easy until you reach phase 3, start that early if you value your sanity. Curves grades based on class average.	7	6/14/2021
		Gupta, Summer 2021. Good guy. His lecture are jam-packed with info. Everything said about him and this class is true. Start early on the phases. Phase 1 and 2 can be done in a day, but Phase 3 will take a while. The entire compiler project takes about 20 hours total for each partner. The exams are hard though, but he tries to give 50% of the class at least a B+.	7	7/27/2021
		Neftali Watkinson Medina was easily one of the best professor's I've had. Makes the class very understandable and is a pretty reasonable professor	7	3/14/2022
		Take this class with Rajiv Gupta. I had him Spring 2022 and lectures were in person and not recorded, however, he kept his summer lecture recordings on canvas and the material was exactly the same. He has the ability to explain very complex topics in a way that makes them easy to understand, a mark of a very good teacher. Very fair grader and will really try to give you as many points as he can. He's always available for help and will even explain things through email if he cannot zoom with you. All in all, he wants you to succeed in his class and will put in effort to make that happen as long as you do too. The class is curved depending on what the average for the exams was. I recommend starting phase 3 early as it is pretty confusing and really long and debugging is an absolute nightmare. Overall was a very fun class!	7	6/10/2022
		I took with professor Zhao, he is super nice and understanding, class was fair, but the final project was super hard, make sure you find people who are committed to meeting up and working together efficiently.	7	1/13/2023
CS153	6.40	I would definitely say it’s one of the hardest CS classes. If you can make it past this one then you can make it past any. But Prof Abu-Ghazaleh is a pretty cool guy nonetheless and teaches the material very well. Just be prepared to put work in. 2 assignments that you work on during lab sessions through the quarter. Exams are very closely related to the homeworks and the sample exams he posts, so study those well. 	9	12/18/2017
		Took it with Nael, thought it was easier than 141. It has a lot of details though, and the labs suck.	8	3/29/2018
		Operating Systems with Professor Song. Labs are tough, worth 40% of your grade, but just ask for help and you should be fine. 2 labs were split in half, for a total of 4 labs for the year. Midterm and Final were pretty much as you would expect, difficult. Homework is difficult as well. As for lecturing style, pretty dull. Nobody really pays attention. Puts notes on the class website. Probably the most difficult class I took so far as far as CS is concerned. Definitely can have a big workload. Beware this one, it's a doozy.	10	6/15/2018
		"Worst class I've taken so far. 

Took it with Song. He's not a good lecturer. In my opinion his accent is extremely difficult to understand and he talks in a very boring fashion. Combine these two ways of speaking and you won't be able to pay attention in class. You will have to teach yourself everything. Do yourself a favor and read the book and slides carefully. The assignments are hard especially the memory reorganizing one. 

Expect a shitty quarter when taking this class lol"	9	6/16/2018
		"everyone is scared of this class an says its hard
tbh its realy not bad, labs suck but just ask for help"	5	8/24/2018
		"Took with Song Spring 2019. Overall I thought this class was moderately difficult at least compared to what other people have said. BUT that's because Song reduced the difficulty of the tests, which he mentioned in the beginning. He gave us all the topics before the tests as well some previous exam questions that ended up on the tests. Homework questions also appeared on the tests. The average for the midterm was a around high 70 percent I think.  Though, maybe this'll change so watch out. Also, and I'm not sure if the other people that reviewed the class had the same lab manual as us, the labs were fairly straightforward. The manuals tell you all the code changes you need to do in the sense that it tells you what functions to change and in what file. Though it can be hard to actually implement the changes you need to do. 
TLDR: Exams and homework fairly decent in terms of difficultly. Labs are the hardest part, but always ask for help from others or TA when you're stuck. If you want to get an in depth knowledge of OS then read the book, its actually a simple and interesting read IMO."	5	6/15/2019
		The labs are fairly easy and the textbook is easy too. However, I had it with Chengyu Song. DO NOT TAKE IT WITH SONG. He literally takes questions straight from the homeworks and previous exams to make each new one. Why is that bad you might ask? Well he curves overall grades by PERCENTILE. To illustrate my point, the class average was a 90% in the class. A 90%. However, because its by percentile, even if your raw grade was a 90+%, you will get curved DOWN unless you did better than 90+% of the class. It's a lazy grading scheme that allows him to put zero effort in his exams and still not have many A's in the class. I would not recommend taking ANY class with him. 	5	6/18/2019
		The labs were supposed to be very difficult and be completed with two people but I was able to finish them all pretty easily.	6	12/10/2019
		"I had Chengyu Song. The actual material can be moderately difficult to grasp, but exams were similar to previous ones and the homework, so it shouldn't be too bad. Our final was literally the previous quarter's final unless I overlooked something. Grades aren't out yet and I don't remember him saying anything about curves, so I'm not sure if that one comment about still being able to get screwed even if you had a 90%+ still holds true.

Labs weren't that bad. First two were probably the hardest and longest but the last two more or less told you everything that you needed to do in the manual. Just start early and ask for help if you're stuck."	7	12/12/2019
		Take professor Song, he might not be the best professor. But he is definately the easiest. Lab is difficult. But once you understand how OS works, it's pretty easy. He will give you majority of the code. You just need to do some minor changes. And his exam are super easy. He will give you almost the same problems for you to study the day before the exam. 	3	2/20/2020
		Took it with Song. It was ok. The labs were alright around 3-4 hours for each lab. You go over lots of super interesting stuff but there is a lot of it. Midterm was easy, final was harder. 	6	1/20/2021
		Nael B. Abu-Ghazaleh is a pretty good professor. Class has fair amount of work and the labs are difficult but exam content isn't too bad and practice exams do help a lot.	7	3/14/2022
		Please don't take with Heng Yin, I can't stress this enough lol. Labs are easier than tests if you ask the right TA.	7	6/11/2022
		Took it with Nael over the summer. Nearly everyone I spoke too averaged a B.  Labs were maybe 3-4 hours of work at most, and both exams were open book.	3	9/6/2022
		Heng Yin is sort of an understanding Professor but also not the easiest Professor. Average on tests like 50-60% and labs and homeworks are brutal. No accommodation if you have covid, if you have mild symptoms he still expects you to come to class. No lecture recordings and every lecture you have to attend in person as there is a quiz at the end. Huge disconnect between lecture and labs.	9	11/30/2022
		Took it with Heng Yin. Horrendous professor with anger issues lol. That's all I got to say. Somehow passed the class with a B.	8	3/31/2023
		Took with Nael. Honestly, he is the GOAT, super sweet, and super understanding of his student's stress over the 60% rule to pass the class. Cannot believe i got an A in the class, but he is truly goated!	3	4/10/2023
CS160	4.50	Took this class with Zizhong Chen, but I think that he might be the only professor that teaches this so far. If you've had him for 161, you'd know how the class will go. You'll have attendance taken everyday, around four HW with usually two weeks to complete them, and 3 exams that have questions basically taken from the homework. Though for the exams, he does have a few extra problems that weren't from the homework, but you should be fine if you read the slides.	3	3/23/2019
		Took with Lesani, pretty easy, midterm an final were very similar to the homeworks	6	12/28/2020
CS161	4.64	Took this class with Prof Chen. Super easy, honestly. Very scary on day one, but turns out to be a big softy. The test questions were verbatim from the homework. Though I heard Najjar is a bit tougher, so you may want to avoid him unless you’re computer engineering in which case you’ll probably want to learn the material really well. 	7	12/18/2017
		Took it with Daniel Wong. His lecture slides are great, and are way better than the textbook - although the newest edition (5th) isn't terrible. I understood everything. Maybe it has something to do with him being a good at teaching, or maybe it's because I understood 61 well. This class is pretty much 61 with some extra stuff ( single/multi cycle, pipelining, caches, VM). I had difficulty with caches, but that might be because I slacked off within the last 2 weeks of the final.	3	6/15/2018
		Took the class with Chen. Lecture was pretty boring and hard to pay attention to, but you're fine as long as you can do the homework since exams are very similar to them.	5	12/15/2018
		"Take this with Zizhong Chen if possible. He straight up takes the homework problems and literally tweaks the numbers and doesn't change anything else at all then puts it on the exams word for word. No final in this class, just 3 exams and 4 homeworks, where exams are 25%/ea, homeworks are 5%/ea and there's 5% attendance (he takes attendance literally everyday, just passes a piece of paper around at the start). 
Course involved pipelining, caches, CPI calculations, optimization algorithms, locality stuff, a single datapath for MIPS and some MIPS to C Code and C Code to MIPS conversions. Sounds kind of scary but it's honestly pretty simple once you start doing it."	1	12/17/2018
		Computer Architecture with Hodjat. The material isn't too bad but Hodjat is not the best at teaching it. Super chill dude though ngl. He's passionate about the subject. The material isn't too bad to learn, some of the stuff later in the class like vm and caches can get tricky. You don't code in this class, just an extension of cs61. Learn about vm, caches, piplining, cpi and stuff. It's not difficult in the typical sense. Just t	7	3/24/2019
		I took this class with Walid Najjar. The concepts we dealt with aren't too difficult IMO. The grading scale was rather generous - there were 2 exams (no final), and the one you get a lower score on counts for 35% of the grade while the one you do better on counts for 45% (total 80%). And we got 7 free percentage points on top of the 80. There are also a variety of homework problems and quizzes, worth 5% and 15% respectively. The lowest scoring homework and quiz gets dropped. Test questions are very similar to the quizzes - the homeworks are slightly harder. The first exam did have a question we did not cover, so we got the same question except with different numbers on the second test.	5	3/27/2019
		No final, 3 midterms based closely on hw, with extra credit questions	4	12/15/2019
		Kuan-Chieh in Summer 2021. This class was not too bad in the beginning, but it picks up. Most people didn't have a bad time in this class, but with Kuan-Chieh, it was sort of a hot mess. He's a really nice guy, but there's just a lot of content  that he doesn't teach very well. A lot of the content on exams could not be found in the textbook nor his lectures. Aside from that, the material is somewhat challenging.	8	7/27/2021
		If with Wajid, focus on the practice problems. 	5	12/10/2021
		Zizhong Chen is a pretty solid professor	4	3/14/2022
		Daniel Enright is the last person you want to take 161 with. He was a TA for awhile in 120A, and now he's teaching a class. The first exam average was a 60% with a deviation of 20. I dropped after I found out my score because there was no way to recover. He didn't know how to teach the material well enough so I was confused on the homeworks. There is a curve in the class that is announced at the end. His expectations on the first exam were unreal.	8	2/26/2023
		Took it with Chen. Lectures are boring and useless but he takes attendance. Overall, I just ignored the class and easily passed with little effort. The tests are like the HW so just study that and look over the slides. I hate that he curved the tests instead of our grade. I doubt a lot of people got As.	4	3/15/2023
CS161L	3.00	Took with Allan Knight Spring 2021. It's weird to say the lecture part of this lab, but the lecture part of this lab is easy. Prof. Knight said he wanted to make it low stress, just learn the topics. One open note multiple choice quiz a week with questions that have 1 obvious answer and 3 joke answers. The lab part is also easy the TA said he wanted us to figure things out for ourselves and then showed us exactly how to do the lab with like one line of code or one function missing. Ok man. If Knight is teaching take it, even if someone recommends you take CS161 and CS161L in different quarters. It's low stakes	3	11/7/2021
CS164	7.40	Took with KK Ramakrishnan. The class has a lot of information and a hefty amount of memorization and conceptual understanding required. KK is great, but the material is inherently dry (unless you're into networks). Working through the (super long) lecture slides was critical to doing well on exams. The labs were tricky, but if you get a good TA it helps a lot. The class wasn't easy, but the grading wasn't too tough. I got an A after putting a good amount of effort in. It was stressful at times, but I recommend the course because networks is so critical to everything these days and I luv KK	6	5/26/2020
		KK. Ramakrishnan. First, is a teacher that cares about the well being of his students. However, this is a rough class, with a lot of work outside of class. You will have a 7 labs, 1 final project, 6 homework assignments, 2 midterms, and 1 final, on top of covering an entire textbook during lectures. This class is no joke. I would take this class only if you REALLY want to learn computer networks, which you will. But it will be a tough road getting there.	9	12/25/2020
		Tons of information to process in the class, be ready to work. 2 Midterms 1 Final, the reviews are very helpful, and the professor does a good job in communicating the concepts and his expectations. 	9	12/16/2021
		This class is hard but super informative. K.K. has hard exams with some tough grades but curves class hella at the end. Some of the labs didn't make sense but they were not too difficult. Go to class for extra credit and to engrain concepts. Not a class you can cram last minute for to get an A. 	8	12/19/2021
		Not that hard. Requires effort at time in regards to doing the labs. The hard part is the quizzes. You have to be on top of the materials and how to write queries. Other than that it's quite hard to fail the class.	5	1/10/2023
CS165	9.60	Computer Security. Took with Zhiyun Qian. Grades are: 8% Project 1, 16% Project 2, 16% Project 3, 5% Attendance/Participation (done on Piazza), 20% Homework (2 homeworks total), 35% Final Exam. The class is really brutal because there's only a single exam (the final) which is worth a massive amount. However, Professor Qian provides many opportunities for overall grade extra credit (like 10-12% total or something more). Project 1 was a password cracker where he gives you the hash/salt/encrypting algorithm and you have to crack the password (with brute force). Project 2 is editing the binary of a program to remove the trial period. Project 3 is stack buffer overflow to create files arbitrarily and also root access hijacking in a shell. It's a really interesting class and if you like security at all you will really enjoy it. It covers Operating System Security, Network Security, and a bunch of other types of security. The average on the final was 22/35 or about 63%. He curved it by like a letter grade or so.	10	3/31/2019
		Took it Ravishankar. I would not recommend this class if it is taught by Ravi. Class needs to be renamed to Number Theory if it is taught by him. Midterm was all number theory and nothing about computer security. Yes, number theory plays a big roll in computer security, but the midterm looked no different from a midterm you'd expect from a number theory course. None of the homework or labs help prepare for exam material.	10	5/8/2020
		"[COVID-19 ERA: SPRING 2020] For all you CSBA majors out there who need this class as it's a core class (and the CS majors who want to take this as a TE), do yourself a favor and AVOID CHINYA RAVISHANKAR LIKE YOU WOULD AVOID CORONA. This class was essentially CS111 on crack. 70% of the class was number theory. We went thru the first 3 chapters of the textbook in 3 weeks and then the next 4-5 weeks was all number theory. 

The midterm? Number theory. We had 1.5 hrs to write it and we all couldn't finish because he made it ridiculously hard. He let us finish it as an assignment the week after we took it but only gave us 2 days to finish it. He doesn't care that we have other classes, he expects us to drop everything to finish his assignments.

One of the labs was a number theory problem set assignment. We had one proper assignment only where 70% of the assignment was number theory proofs and the rest of the 30% was programming. Even then, the programming portion of the assignment was the hardest part because he gives absolutely no direction with how we should go about doing it and we only had one week to do it. It was due on the day of the midterm. This should have been a 2 week assignment.

The project was the worst part of the class. It was more of a networking project than it was a security project. He gave us the last 3 weeks of the quarter to do it with the skeleton starter code. But the code was broken and it took them 1.5 weeks for them to fix it and give us the fixed version. I don't think anyone managed to finish the project in time.

The only saving grace was the TA (al), this is the third time I've had this TA, he's pretty useless but grades on effort rather than completion, so we all ended up getting 100% on everything (except the midterm).

Ravi is teaching this class in Fall 2020 as well. Do yourself a favor and wait until Winter 2021 to take it with the other professor. Ravi does not care that everything is online nor that we're in the middle of two major milestones in the country rn (COVID-19 pandemic &  nationwide protests to combat racism). He thinks that, because we're all at home, we would have all the time in the world to do his assignments. He also thinks this is the only class we're taking. He legit does not give a fuck. Do not take him. You'll only give yourself more work, stress, and headache than you can handle."	10	6/23/2020
		Ravi made 111 look like child's play and Elena the equivalent of Mother Teresa fuck my life	10	2/17/2021
		Took it with Zhiyan. Lectures are boring so make sure to learn it after. Very few hws and study material for the exams. Exams are very theoretical design questions. The projects are probably the only fun thing about this class. Mostly focuses on low-level (assembly) code execution and attacks, doesn’t teach you much about network security.	8	12/10/2021
CS166	8.44	Vassilis Tsotras. Midterm wasn't too bad, final was a bit more difficult. The scope of the course is a pretty general intro to database stuff, sql and indexing and whatnot. Labs can be tough but not as bad as some other classes. Mostly effort based. One project at the end of the class, not too bad, implementing some sql and stuff with user input and a java wrapper. 4 homeworks from the book. Not the easiest upper div but definitely not the hardest.	8	12/15/2018
		Chinya Ravishankar, remember that name. That's the professor, he is terrible. One of the worst professors you'll ever have in your life. This guy has daddy issues. In class, majority of his discussion is about how smart he is and how dumb we are. The finals are stupid hard. He doesn't give any instruction or outline on what to focus on. I understand how that's okay but this class has a lot of information, it seems fair to help us a bit. The midterm average was a D and final average was an F. Professor doesn't curve. 	10	12/14/2019
		Vasilis Tsotras cannot fucking teach	10	10/8/2021
		This class in itself is hard, but in my opinion manageable. The lecture from Vassilis J. Tsotras is quite boring but I suggest that you attend anyway because it is important to your midterms and finals. The lab and project, however, sucked so much! It's like they did not put in ANY effort whatsoever into designing the lab and projects! Pretty much all of their scripts provided fail out of box and you have to spend extra time for some really unnecessary debugging, such a waste of time!	9	11/30/2022
		Update Fall 2022: Vasilis Tsotras still cannot fucking teach.	8	12/11/2022
		The class went to hell as soon as the TAs went on strike and that was when we were working on the final part of our projects. There was no help at all, and it was just chaotic and stressful. Garbage graders and TAs that were clueless during labs. Vasilis Tsotras lectures aren't even worth attending besides one time when he asked a personal irrelevant fucking question on one of the quizzes and didn't make it extra credit, nor made it any easier to answer.	10	12/21/2022
		CS166 was not hard conceptually, but what made this class hard was the professor being an awful lecturer, but the overwhelming amount of work. Final project plus weekly labs as well as homework every two weeks and quizzes corresponding to those quizzes. It’s an overwhelming amount of work. 	6	1/13/2023
CS167	5.50	Ahmed Eldawy is an excellent professor, one of the best CS professors I've personally had at this university. This was a unique class in the sense that we had 3 midterms but no final, and labs were heavily emphasized as well. Not too hard but difficulty varied throughout the quarter, some labs were just a pain to get through while others were done in an hour. An eye-opening class into the world of Big Data and you learn a lot, we probably learned like five or six different programming languages. Some of the concepts will overlap with other classes like SQL.	6	6/2/2021
		Take this class with Eldawy. The labs are very annoying and tedious so be ready to go to the TAs office hours. The exams are alright, I didn't do too well on them so I relied on labs, final project, hws, etc to bring me to a B. 	5	3/31/2023
		Took this class with Professor Eldawy in Winter 2023. The class was not too hard. Sometimes the labs took a really long time to finish but that was mostly due to issues that I had when I had to set up a lab. Other than that, the labs were relatively easy especially if you ask the TA for help when you need it. Although I recommend doing the labs the moment they are released in case you run into any issues during the week (especially when we were only given less than a week to complete it). The exams were not hard but still have to study for it of course. Overall, not too hard to get an A if you put in the time and effort. 	6	4/3/2023
		Took with Eldway in Winter 2022, it was a chill class, midterms were REALLY fair, no final, 3 midterms, and final project. Attend class to pass, he does in class assignments that are close to midterms and how he'll ask the questions! Only downside was final project, it was a pain and my senioritis kicked in, but got it done! overall not a bad tech elective to take	5	4/10/2023
CS168	7.00	Took with Sheldon Tan in Winter 2020. Not too bad. The homework and tests were mostly just evaluating logic statements, interpreting transistor-level circuits, or some sizing calculations which comes down to plug and chug. Labs were as easy as following the instructions exactly as they're written, it just got annoying having to correct literally 1000 errors. It isn't hard to correct, it's just tedious since you're making sure you don't let two transistors get too close in a circuit 1000 times.	5	11/7/2021
		Labs are very very very tedious. The lectures are really hard to follow. If you aren't a CEN/EE, leave while you still can. If you haven't taken EE100A yet, make sure to do that before taking this course. It's doable without, but it's definitely easier if you have that background (still very hard anyway).	9	10/19/2022
CS169	10.00			
CS170	4.63	As long as it’s taught by Eamonn Keogh you’ll have a great time. Super cool professor with an Irish accent who really loves Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. He makes the material pretty simple, the exams pretty straight-forward, and always plays really cool music videos before class starts. He assigns 2 projects with an arseload of time to complete them. 	6	12/18/2017
		This is the class that doesn't exist. A CS upper div that doesn't completely kill you. It's not easy per say, but a lot easier than some of the options out there. W/ Eamonn. 2 projects, written in whatever language you desire. No discussion. Tests - 1 midterm 1 final. They were during class hours, multiple choice. Some quizzes, but he'll give you notice of them beforehand so not too bad. All in all an interesting class. Easier than most of the other upper div cs ones so keep an eye out. 	5	12/15/2018
		Take it with Eamonn Keogh if you can. Midterm and final were completely MC and he assigned two project with a lot of time to do them. There was one HW assignment as well as a couple quizzes. No discussions either. The tests might be relatively difficult, but overall the class isn't very demanding and shouldn't take up much of your time compared to other CS upper divs.	5	2/12/2019
		Took it with Dr Keogh, and this class was very simple and fair. The two projects were as easy as Dr Keogh suggests. That doesn't mean you should not start it early. The reports are what takes your time. The exams are multiple choice and very fair. He gives out some quizzes, which have been known to have questions that show up on the final.	3	12/27/2019
		Lovely professor. 2 relatively easy projects. Infrequent quizzes that he gives you ample notice of. Exams and quizzes worth small portions of grade and are straight from lecture	3	1/29/2022
		Class was easy with professor Keogh, two projects , final, midterm, one homework assignment overall super easy	4	1/13/2023
		Took it with Niloofar Montazeri even though everyone said to avoid her. Her lectures are hard to understand.. There is no curve. Exams easier than expected. Theres two big coding projects that your grade relies on that she grades very generously. The first project had an average score of 105% lol 	6	3/31/2023
CS171	9.62	"When you read the title of the class you probably think ""Sweet Machine Learning, this is going to be awesome"" but it's a trap! TBH this class should have several pre reqs that are really needed in order to succeed. You need to def have Calc3/Physics > above level math skills. You really need to take Statistics before this class. Lastly you need to at least be an intermediate Python user. You will be doing proofs and if you're proof is wrong there is no way to complete a HW assignment. You need to be familiar with Python or be confused with how to do the HW. The lectures are terrible. It's just the prof reading his slides which are 80% just unlabeled graphs. The slides provided have no context so you have to come to class to understand them but even if you do no one knows what the prof is talking about and are too afraid to ask for clarification, everyone literally admitted this during a talk in the discussion. The exams don't really test you on topics the prof taught but rather you're general knowledge of the algorithms basically he expects you to know the ins and outs of the algorithms even if he didn't directly tell you about them. If you really want to take a Machine Learning course just watch Andrew NG's youtube videos, you'll learn more, not be stressed out, and you'll actually have fun. If you still want to take the course I hope you're a math god that studies every night. "	10	12/14/2018
		"This is probably one of the hardest CS technical electives I have ever taken. I took it with Christian Shelton who is probably one of the best and smartest professors in CS. He's very passionate and interesting to listen to and he teaches the material in a way that keeps you interested. But, ML is inherently a very difficult field to understand, so there's only so much he can do. There are 4 homeworks(he calls them Problem Sets), two midterms and 1 final. Homeworks count for 33%, midterms count for 33% and the final counts for the last 33% of the course grade. Homeworks are done in Python on JupyterHub where he usually gives you a little bit of skeleton code.
Do not be like me and think that ML is some Computer Science magic that makes you an oracle who can predict the future. Because it's not CS. It's linear algebra and statistics except we program it so they call it a CS class. But conceptually, this is almost purely statistics/linear algebra."	10	12/17/2018
		Professor Shelton is definitely smart and capable to teaching lots of difficult concepts, but this class seems inherently difficult. I'm an ex-math major, and even I found the math to be a bit hard to wrap my head around at times. In this class, you learn the theory of many classic ML algorithms, and then you are expected to implement them. Overall, I think that this course requires more time for what is covered.	10	2/14/2019
		"It's honestly not too bad. I think the first couple of lectures definitely scare off a lot of people because of how much math there is, but it's honestly not as difficult people say it is. Definitely recommend taking it with a friend though, since it'll make understanding material a little easier if you have someone to talk it out with. Highly recommend going to office hours too because Shelton does talk a little fast. Overall learned a lot and didn't really ""struggle"" that much compared to what other people are saying, would definitely take it again. "	8	3/26/2019
		It hurt so fucking much.	10	12/7/2019
		Most painful and rewarding class I've ever taken in my entire life. Everyone was numb and scared in the end including the big brains that always sit in the front. Take with Shelton if you really want a challenge.	10	12/15/2019
		The class lectures are super important, so going to class is necessary to pass. The slides Dr Shelton uses don't have much information on them, so you need to go to class or office hours to understand the material and examples well. You will need to study the slides well, because the exams are difficult if you didn't understand a topic went over. The final exam was the hardest. The homework sets we're difficult, unless you started them early enough to ask questions properly. 	9	12/27/2019
		"I thought this would be an awesome chance to continue learning about ML stuff because it's always stood out as something interesting to me. Oh my fucking god this one class actually just made me so sad, you really need to have a solid understanding of lin alg going into the class or you're already screwed. Taking this probably hurt my chances at grad school a bit too.
I think the CS department should rework the prereqs for this course because it's anemic and setting some bright-eyed students up to fail. To do well, you absolutely have to be passionate about the topic and theory. Having the mindset of ""oh ML sounds cool, I should take it,"" is imho, not enough for you to succeed. You gotta know that this is what you want to do and be ready to commit your soul and final 2 brain cells to this course, I recommend taking easier breadth courses in the same quarter as this class to relieve pressure, don't double up with other major req'd courses or tech electives, you're absolutely going to regret it and be depressed and in pain while regretting it."	10	6/10/2020
		what the fuck	10	7/27/2020
		"Fun course topic, but incredibly challenging. By far the hardest course I've taken in all of my 4 years at UCR. There are no easy or ""free"" points in this class. Every question on every problem set, midterm, and final are very involved and a minor mistake can lead to only getting half/partial credit. You'll need to be very comfortable with Python by week 2 or you will not be able to keep up with the assignments even if you have a solid understanding of statistics and math. I thought I was comfortable with the prereqs, and still ended with a C-. (Shelton)"	10	12/19/2020
		iEvals are out for Spring 2021 so I figured I'd update here too. Asif lectured this quarter my perception is that he's slightly easier than Shelton but you still learn a lot. The class is super hard, but also very interesting and rewarding if you like the topic	10	5/24/2021
		Took this class with Professor Salman Asif. His exams aren't that bad, but his homework assignments are absolutely brutal. The TA isn't very helpful (at least for this quarter), and if you don't take this class with a friend it's very hard to get by. You need a combination of Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Statistics to get by in this class (like a very solid understanding). It's definitely more of a math class than a CS class. I think Professor Asif is a passionate professor and really tries to help anyone as long as they ask for help.	10	11/30/2022
		Taken with Christian Shelton in Spring 2023. Honestly, the midterms kicked my butt but if you start the homework relatively early and attend office hours, you'll be fine grade-wise. Studying the practice problems was not enough for me, but it's difficult to study the concepts even more than what's provided with the slides and example problems. I recommend finishing PS2 (homework 2) before the first midterm or at least looking over logistic regression as that was a big component on the first midterm, but the due date for PS2 was after the midterm, so I missed basically two questions on the midterm. Points are very scarce in this class, so try to maximize all the points you can with homework and answer everything in the midterm to try to get partial credit. The curve at the end of Spring 2023 was actually about 10%, so you can expect something around a whole letter grade curve at the end of the class. Good luck, and make sure to just study the slides/problem sets. The problem sets are okay if you go to office hours and reference the professor's personal notes. Overall a rewarding class, but definitely one of the harder tech electives.	8	3/27/2023
CS172	5.67	I've taken the class with Professor Mariam Salloum, and she's honestly so great. Her lecture slides are super clear and straight to the point. She's super helpful and always answers the questions to the best of her ability. Discussions were actually pretty helpful. Assignments(2 in the quarter) were super easy and actually pretty fun to program. She does keep track of attendance and gives quizzes, so be sure to keep up with the material. There's 2 midterms and no final, but she assigns a project instead to make up for it. Overall, Information Retrieval is a super interesting class where the information and assignments are doable. Also curved my grade to from a B+ to A- even though I was 0.7% from a 90%.	6	3/26/2019
		Took this with Dr Salloum. The slides for the class have too much information on them, so it's hard to tell what to study for the exams. Dr Salloum gives out study sheets, which tell you what to study and they are useful. The homeworks can be difficult if not started early. The final project is done in either python or Java. It can be easy if your group partners are good.	5	12/27/2019
		I had Vagelis Hristidis (Spring 2022). I choose this class to satisfy the computer networks requirement for CSBA and tbh its not that bad of a class, its just that Vagelis is not the best at lecturing and explaining the concepts. The midterms weren't too bad, but those true/false questions stumped a lot of us for sure, mostly due to how poorly worded they were. Also for the projects make sure you get into a group with people you can trust to finish on time and know python/java. Theres also a huge curve at the end went from a C to a B+	6	6/11/2022
CS175	3.67	"Get a good group. The entire class is just one huge group business project with CS and if your group sucks well...
 This class has an amazing professor though who loves participation so definitely participate in class and he gives really cool life lessons. He keeps saying not to worry about grades so we’ll see how the quester goes (Spring 2020, online) "	4	5/8/2020
		Not too bad. Faloutsos is a great professor, and it's more fun if you participate (but it's also an 8am class). Attendance, reading, and participation are self-reported. Most of the grade hinges on your final investor pitch, but you should be totally fine if you just do the assignments earnestly and have a small demo product (doesn't need to be complex). 	3	6/15/2021
		One of my favorite classes! Faloutsos is S tier, and you will learn a lot. It's a great class if you're considering to make a startup. Try to come in with a team of people you trust though, since the whole class is basically a group project where you make a startup.	4	9/18/2022
CS179E	9.50	The class is just one big project with 4 phases. If you're a pro at Java and CS152, then this might be easier for you. The CS179 courses are pretty hard overall, so you really need to choose the focus you understood the best...unfortunately not all senior projects are available in a quarter. 	10	10/17/2021
		Took the class during summer 2022 and the class wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but I recommend starting the projects as early as possible. Setting it up was a hassle and would recommend using IntelliJ than VSCode as its easier to debug there than the latter. The ta was very helpful as he helped my group understand the concept and answered our questions. Also for this quarter the ta asked the professor change his gradings where your grades are determined by the amount of testers you passed but it also includes the effort or amount of code you done (meaning the code would work but just have a bug) though I'm not sure if the system is being kept for the next class. Overall not too bad class, and depending how good of a java coder and how much you know of compilers from cs152 would determine the amount of time you would work on the projects. START EARLY!!	9	9/23/2022
CS179F	5.00	Take this class with Heng Yin. Yes it’s operating systems and it sucks but the class was easy. Choose one of his listed projects, find it somewhere online as someone’s hw assignment and list that as the source and work on your project. He has check-ins here and there but wasn’t too strict. Ended with an A+ and honestly we didn’t even work till the last week and kept showing random code during the check-ins. Report heavy so make that look good and you’ll be fine. 	2	5/8/2020
		5 Lab assignments with grading scripts. No demo. If you know what you're doing, it will be easy. If you don't know what you're doing, some Chinese guy on the internet did know what they were doing and posted the solutions online.	6	3/23/2023
		Took with Chengyu Song. It's basically an extension of CS153 labs. You have 5 labs that are taken from MIT's 6.828 (Utilities, Allocator, Copy on-write, File system, and mmap). Each lab is worth 20% of your final grade. You will also have to turn in a lab report with each lab. There is a lecture once a week and a discussion once a week. Attendance not mandatory. I ended up with an A, so I didn't think this class was that bad, but others might think otherwise, since some of the labs towards the end are pretty time consuming/confusing.	7	4/4/2023
CS179G	4.00	Took with Mariam Salloum. Plan, design, then build a project involving a database. Weekly status reports are straightforward and fairly quick. One ethics essay in the middle of the quarter. A few presentations to the class. Course is not meant to be difficult. The difficulty really depends on how ambitious of a project you choose and how well your team works together. Enjoyable class overall	3	1/12/2020
CS179J	6.00	Took it with Najjar. I was pretty scared going into this course because I hated CS120B but it wasn't bad at all. You have a lot of leeway with what you want to do for your project. Our arudino setup was super simple and the majority of our project was just code. He's a pretty relaxed professor who just want to see you enthusiastic about your project. 	6	3/31/2023
CS179M	5.00	I took this class with Professor Keogh. This class barely had any AI at all and was basically an extension and more complex version of the 8-puzzle project from CS170. It had some business-like elements to this class such as preparing questions to ask the customer (who is the professor) and presenting a project pitch to the customer. I feel like a bit too much time was spent towards this business part of class. The last few weeks you just work on coding your project with your team. We did not have too many class meetings during the last few weeks since we were mostly coding on our own. The professor often had office hours to help with anything. Our project was missing a couple features and had a couple bugs but we still managed to get an A. I would say the GUI part of the project was a pain if you lack experience so make sure to start on that early. Overall, I wish this class delved more into AI. This was not an entirely easy class but you can get an A if you put in the effort and time into it.	7	4/3/2023
		Eamonn Keogh runs this senior project class every once in a while. GRAB IT IF YOU CAN, realistically the class is mainly about working together and prepping a business pitch rather than coding. Coding is prob like 15/100 of the credit you get for finishing the quarter long project. SUPER CHILL, loved it! 	3	4/10/2023
CS179N	2.50	super easy. Student presentations and a final project. Meets once per week for one hour and one lab. Just build a game or something. Had Tamar but I don't think that really matters.	2	6/22/2019
		All you have to do is make a game in a group of 4 to 5 people. As long as you show good progress in each demo and make sure your scrum sheet's in order, you should be totally fine. Easy A	2	6/15/2021
		Super fun class. Make sure you have a group of 4 other people that you trust! It's basically a requirement that you have experience with a game engine like Unity or Unreal. It's a great opportunity to put something on your resume and make something you're passionate about!	4	9/18/2022
CS180	6.00	The whole class is esentially to build something. Anything really, but they give you a list of things at the beginning and you present a thing at the end. Most of the class does like android applications or websites/stuff like that. Make sure you have a solid team. There is no midterm, the final is ok, fair since he tells you what to study for. Took w Zhijia Zhao.	7	12/15/2018
		This class is really dumb. Study up on some front-end tech like react or angular, or hope someone carries you.	5	2/12/2019
		Took it with Manu Sridharan. The midterm and final were pretty straightforward as long as you review the slides. Coding is only done when dealing with the class project which is like 50 pts out of 100 total points so pretty important. 	7	12/16/2019
		"I gave this class a low difficulty rating but really it depends on how comfortable you are to the technology you will use and your team mates.

First thing is first. This is a group project class. If you don't already plan to take this class with people you know you may already have an increased difficulty. Overall the class is basically ""make anything"" and present it at the end of the class. The lectures are basically a repeat of what you've learned from other classes like CS 100. Basically it focuses on Agile Development for a majority of the time. 

The class tends to push you in the direction of make a web application but really they tell you you can make anything with any tech you want but because you have team mates they will more than likely make you pick a web application as well. The first lab is in React.js so you'll more than likely choose that to work with. 

For those who don't know anything about web dev stuff make sure to get a team that does because tbh it's to late to learn a lot of this stuff. Web dev consists of HTML, CSS, JS/React, and some back end Server stuff. There is no way you'll learn all of this in this semester. You either already know some of this or you'll just be a drag to you're team mates. I suggest learning as much as you can before taking the course. Try the site Codecademy. They have HTML,CSS, and React lectures for free.

I rated this class a 6 because I already knew HTML,CSS and had a very rough understanding of React. I definitely grew in terms of React knowledge but did have team mates intimidated that they didn't know what was going on."	6	12/17/2019
		Make sure you match up with people you can trust in the project!	7	5/8/2020
		I took this with Professor Manu and found this class pretty easy going since I was familiar with web dev. We had quizzes and homework, no final, just a final presentation. The quizzes and homework are stuff from the slides, but quizzes were in person so it was all from memory. The final project which spanned 7 weeks which was just taking CSV data reading it and creating a backend off it without using a database. Then making a frontend to display that data through API calls to the backend. If you are unfamiliar with React, HTML/CSS, Django or Express, JavaScript, Python, then you should probably study up on some these before taking this class. Otherwise be willing to learn your part of the project so you don't drag your teammates down. Doing well on the quizzes and homework really determines whether you get an A or not. If you don't do well you'll most likely end up with a high B. Hard to fail this class, but hard to get an A as well. Professor Manu is really cool and relatable though!	4	12/7/2021
CS181	9.00	"Hardest class you will ever take in your entire life. Only take it if you are 100% into Computer Science, otherwise if you're a normie like majority of CS students, you will for sure fail or get a really low score in the class. 
Shelton is great professor, but this class really hits hard with the assignments. Problem Sets (4% of your grade, given 5 times in the quarter) are doable, but if you aren't a great programmer, you will not be able to get by since the Programming Assignments are 8% of your grade and there are 4 of them in the entire quarter. Exams are honestly not too bad if you are paying attention in class. "	10	3/26/2019
		"Took with Shelton. He is a great lecturer and professor with a clear passion for teaching. However, he likes to challenge students in programming assignments. Tests are easier as long as you make sure to study the topics well (the textbook is helpful when studying for tests). 

There was homework due every week, alternating between ""problem sets"" (standard question&answer homework; there's 5 of these) and ""programming assignments"" (4 of these). No programming questions on the tests, just knowledge based questions on different aspects of programming languages (note this may include writing snippets of code as examples of whatever the question is asking about). 

Overall, I found the class to be on the difficult side, mostly due to the programming assignments. I am still glad to have taken it however, as I do feel I learned a lot. Also there seemed to be a curve applied to our grades at the end of the quarter, even though Shelton is reluctant to admit that his classes are curved (for our class it seemed to be 7-8%, ymmv)."	8	3/27/2019
CS182	6.00	"Took with Manu Sridharan. He's a good professor, but the class's difficulty mainly comes from which open-source project you pick. A gamble, really. You can team up or do it on your own. The goal of the project is to get you familiar with testing and generating code coverage. The project isn't exactly graded on how correctly you test, but rather if you can successfully test and use your testing tools (i.e. JaCoCo for Java). You document all your testing in a final project report at the end of the quarter.

Lecture/Discussion uses Java and Gradle, so you may have to do some research if your project uses different tools. When picking a project, try to pick one that has good documentation and already has tests - saves you a lot of time. If you pick a big project, you can opt to test only a module of the project instead of the entire thing. A great way to find projects is the CodeTriage website.

No midterm/final - just a couple of quizzes that cover concepts from the slides + homework."	6	10/11/2020
CS183	4.00	"I hated this class. Jason Ott normally does it. It's basically IT class. It seems pretty easy but my lack of enthusiasm (especially in the beginning) made things harder. I didn't know ""Systems Administration"" meant IT, and when I did, it was too late to drop it. His lecture slides aren't that great. You're better off showing up to lecture and taking good notes. The slides won't help all that much when it comes to studying for an exam. He's not terrible at teaching it though."	5	6/15/2018
		take it with Jason Ott, good teacher and easy class 	2	6/16/2018
		Took with Abdoli. It's an overview of managing/maintaining a UNIX server and it's a pretty nice class. It gives you some good breathing room for your other classes as a CS major, so keep that in mind. Labs are done on a CentOS vm and they're pretty straightforward. Sometimes you'll have to script in Perl/Bash/Python. You'll be told which slides to study for the midterm/final, although the final is cumulative. 	3	10/11/2020
		Took with Alireza Abdoli. This guy is G. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM. 	6	12/25/2020
CS201	6.50	Took this course with Prof. Zhijia Zhao, winter22. This course mainly explains some knowledge about the middle end of LLVM, the course is well structured, Professor Zhao lectures quite well, there are 5 assignments and 3 projects, homework questions and midterm and final questions are very similar, project may take some time for the first exposure, once you understand, the project can be said to be very straightforward, and at the same time can help you deepen your understanding of the course content. If you want to take this class, I recommend it.	6	3/28/2022
		Had Gupta in Fall 2022. A lot of the course material isn't too difficult to grasp, but because there aren't a lot of examples, it can be hard to solve problems on the exams. I recommend making your own examples, and going to him for OH about them. There isn't a ton of resources on the material online (as is for most CS grad classes), so this can really hurt you when you may not understand edge cases and whatnot for a problem. Besides that, the project can be very overwhelming, so start learning how to work with LLVM and Clang at the beginning of the quarter. Basically, these allow you to parse a cpp file, and perform analysis on it. There isn't a lot of beginner-friendly documentation on this either, so you ought to get started as soon as you can.	7	12/18/2022
CS202	7.33	Fall 2022, Prof. Hyoseung Kim, Lots of research paper critiques, Lots of lab assignments	7	10/21/2022
		As a CS student, I had to take 2 out of 3 core courses and I chose Operating Systems as I enjoyed it as an undergraduate. While this course has commonalities with my previous course, it was more rigorous and I had to spend significant time on my labs. There are multiple graded components in this course: Examinations, Paper reviews, Labs. It is important to choose good team members as finishing the labs along with your coursework can get very hectic. The examinations are straightforward and the professor clearly explains what questions are going to come in the examinations. The critiques can be demanding. I think that this was an easily-scoring core course than its counterparts. Some nuggets of advice from my end are: a) Manage your time efficiently as the quarter system gets over quickly and the labs/critique reviews require sufficient time and effort. b) If you are struggling with the course, talk to the TAs, they are very helpful :). c) I really liked Udacity's OS courses that acts a good review for similar topics. Neso Academy's OS Playlist is also good if you have doubts.	8	12/15/2022
		Labs are relatively easy. Go to class and you will be fine.	7	3/20/2023
CS203	7.75	Midterm, project, and Final are crazy hard.	9	12/10/2019
		Take this class with Prof Daniel Wong if you can, even if you're CS trash like me and have no interest in computer architecture. You learn a lot and it's bizarrely not that stressful. 3 coding assignments that he sets up to be extremely simple to jump right into and reinforce the concepts taught during lecture; it's the kind of coding/problem-solving that's challenging and satisfying. The final project is harder and less structured but he's super helpful. Midterm and final were really straightforward as long as you did the assignments and study the sample(s) he provides. Prof Wong is the best and just wants everyone to learn and succeed. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended core class. Like you should take this class just because Professor Wong's friendliness and attention to detail is a breath of fresh air	4	3/19/2021
		Took this course with Prof. Hung-Wei, Tseng in Fall21. Each week there are some papers that are required to read, and do read them, some will appear in midterm and final. Moreover, there is a project, you will need to do quite a lot of search when working on it. Generally speaking, this course is challenging, but you will learn a lot even if you're not interested (or your main study field) is not computer architecture.	8	4/27/2022
		There is weekly reading of up to 3 articles/chapters with reading quizzes. The homework is long and arduous start early or you will suffer. This class is homework and test based now. Be prepared to show up and talk during class.	10	5/23/2023
CS205	5.00	DO NOT CHEAT and you'll get a good grade easily. Class depends on midterm(30%), 2 projects, reading and 2 paper presentations. Grading is super lenient and Prof. LePendu gives out a lot of bonus points. 	5	5/7/2020
CS206	10.00	Project and exams are crazy hard	10	6/2/2021
CS210	8.50	Took with Shinar for Fall '22. 80% of this class is linear algebra. 40% of the grade is homework (there were 5 hw assignments but she drops your lowest), and 30% is midterm, 30% final. This class requires a lot of practice, and because there's a lot of material, it's important you organize all of it so you can recall it all.	9	12/18/2022
		The description is a bit vague this is an applied linear algebra class. Professor was very fast paced and difficult to follow because of that. Consists of around 8 homework, midterm and final. The tests are very difficult just doing the homework will not be enough know the material well.	8	2/22/2023
CS215	9.00	Inherently difficult subject. However, professor Amey offered a lot of help and a decent amount of extra credit.	9	3/20/2023
CS217	7.00	This class is definitely a fun one if you're paying attention! Prof. Wong gives awesome lectures that help out with the assignments and final project. As long as you thoroughly pay attention during the lectures, this class will be enjoyable. If you give it your best effort, you will have a good time! Also, this class focuses on how GPU's can be used for their parallelism capabilities rather than anything related to computer graphics (although the topic does come up once in a while).	7	12/18/2022
CS218	9.00	Prof Lonardi is the best for this course and is a very good grader. The subject itself is difficult but with enough effort, you'll ace the class. Do the homeworks yourself and exams will be a breeze. Finals carry a lot of weight(50%)	9	5/7/2020
CS226	4.00	5 coding assignments, midterm and a project with poster presentation. Prof. Eldawy is amazing and a very good grader! 	4	5/7/2020
CS229	9.00	Shelton is awesome, but holy hell this class is hard. I took it before 224 was an option and I was excited to take this class to find out if ML is for me... it most certainly is not. It's all math, most of which went over my head. The saving grace is that fat curve; you can expect a B as long as you put in honest effort. During the low moments when this class had me questioning my life choices, it was genuinely really comforting to know that I could expect to pass. You're gonna get your ass kicked by that brutal 3 hour final.	9	3/19/2021
CS235	6.33	Took with Papalexakis. He's an awesome professor, and gets you thinking more like a researcher. 60% of your grade is a project that you need to present as a research report. The other 40% consists of quizzes (reading research papers), the midterm, and the final. It's a great experience, but start learning Python early if you don't know it yet. Specifically when it comes to using sci-kit and implementing a clustering/classification algorithm.	5	3/28/2023
		Took it with Papalexakis. All multiple choice quizzes and exams, and a project that was worth 60% of your grade. You work with 5 other people and implement 6 different machine learning models. I think overall the class wasn't that bad, just the organization of the project was all over the place. Regardless, there was a hefty curve at the end and the class was very interesting.	7	4/4/2023
CS236	7.00	Entire class grade is based on a project, midterm, and final. Pretty easy if you can stay awake during lecture.	7	12/10/2019
		This class isn't to hard the lecture can be very boring, the tests are multiple choice and there is a project.	7	5/23/2023
CS240	3.00	Course entirely based on project(100%). Prof Faloutsos is very cool and grades well if you do a good job on the project! Equal contribution from team members is crucial.	3	5/7/2020
CS242	3.00	The grade depends on quizzes, project, 1 assignment and a midterm(40%). Grading is super easy and the subject is a sure-shot A. Plus, Prof. Hristidis is amazing!	2	5/7/2020
		Great course.Very good class, only midterms and two projects, weekly quiz, but also very easy. The only point to notice might be to find a good team to do the project.	4	3/28/2022
CS251	9.00	"One of the worst grad classes I've taken. I often refer to this class as a catfish class because the title is very misleading to a lot of students. It's called Real-time Embedded Systems, but you won't be working with bread boards or anything. In fact, you won't really be working with embedded systems at all. Most of the class focuses on the ""Real-time"" part of the title. So actually, most of what you'll be learning relates to operating systems and considerations for these systems (communication, power, etc.). The material itself isn't extremely tough, but the lack of guidance on the labs will throw you for a loop. Overall, one of my least favorite CS classes I've taken at UCR."	9	3/28/2023
CS253	8.00	The lectures are a bit hard to understand what is happening. The project was a bit tricky due to concurrency needed and trouble debugging that. The tests are free formed so be prepared to info dump so be sure to keep up and study. Professor Ravishankar is very knowledge in the area	8	5/23/2023
DNCE005	2.79	Super easy. Just show up and dance. Three essays. Super simple. 	1	3/31/2017
		"Easy. Luck of the draw in terms of who's teaching but it's mainly just dancing and maybe some outside ""projects."" One mandatory essay (minimum) across the classes and you must bring someone to watch for your final."	1	3/30/2019
		I rated it as difficult because I ended up taking it with the TA Jennifer Wong. If you end up with her, please do not take the class; you’ll be taking contact improvisation, a very uncomfortable class. Example: we were told to lie down while our partners have us massages. I ended up feeling violated, seriously. Jennifer was nice, but naive at times about how uncomfortable people were. Don’t tell people to lie down for massages, Jen. Not everyone wants a full body massage. Anyways, contact improvisation is a very touchy class . So, if you’re the type of person who wouldn’t mind giving someone a full body massage, take it. If you’d feel weird and grossed out about it and wouldn’t want someone you may barely know, DO NOT take it. Don’t make the same mistake that I did!!!	10	4/15/2019
		Took the Filipino Countryside Folk Dancing class; a little bit difficult if you’re a beginner but it’s easy to get an A by the end of the quarter. Jim’s harsh but means well. 	3	12/17/2019
		Entirely depends on the TA that you get! Each TA specializes in a different field of dance so there were hip hop classes, west African, Filipino Folk dancing, etc. Some people got marked off for lack of effort/ participation so just be engaged in class. 	2	1/3/2020
		I had it with Dava Hernandez for Mexican Folklorico and its pretty easy. She's super nice, understanding, and flexible. You just show up to Zoom and dance/participate. There's some readings, discussion posts, and papers but its not too bad. I looked forward to this class cause it got me out of my chair and moving.	3	10/29/2020
		Highly recommend taking during online classes, all we did was discuss dance videos and do a one second a day midterm and random dance video for our final.	2	3/18/2021
		Super Easy, we only had to show up once a week to class and keep a journal, that was it lol 	1	4/18/2021
		I had Manny and our focus was modern dance. it was really chill and easy. the first half of class theres some dancing (easy exercises and moving around) and the second half was the lecture (all slides were online). the midterm was a combo of multiple choice q's, short answer, and an essay based on a dance performance you have to go to. it sounds like a lot but its rly not. final is a 2 min group dance performance that you choreograph together and a few paragraphs about the process	3	5/23/2021
		Very fun and easy class if you wanna fulfill your breadth requirements! The class was online for me unfortunately, but I had a lot of fun anyways. I had Yeji Moon (TA) as my instructor and our genre of focus was K-Pop which made it even easier for me since I already listened to the genre on the daily and have a background in dance. 2 dance video projects, 1 essay, and weekly discussion posts you have to participate in. As long as you try on the assignments you’ll be fine, and you don’t really need a background in dance to do well. Don’t forget to participate on the weekly discussion posts because it’s very easy to forget, and some easy points to lose if you don’t do them. Attendance isn’t mandatory for the class, but you should go to the sessions where you have to learn your dance piece to see what is expected of you regarding your dance video projects. Overall great class that doesn’t require too much effort!	2	12/19/2021
		I got Al as my instructor and she's great. This class is overall really chill and fun but you definitely will need to put in efforts for this class and pay attention.	5	2/15/2022
		Just show up to class and do the dance journals (only 250 words) and it's an easy A. I had Johnny Castro for hiphop and I'm actually kind of sad it's over. It was a fun class in the midst of all the STEM classes.	1	3/18/2022
		IF YOU GET FABIOLA TORRALBA DROP IMMEDIATELY and choose another section with another TA. She makes the class more philosophical than it should be. We spend a maximum of 3 hours out of the 30 hours of attending class to learn any sort of choreography, the rest of the time its just her talking about her life or walking around the room for a good 2 hours. The class should not have been as difficult as it is. There are many long assignments that she assigns, none of them relating to dance at all. She kind of picks and chooses how many points she wants to give out to certain students as well.	4	3/29/2023
		took with yeji moon about kpop and really loved it! pretty simple dance class. make sure you end up with a group you like working with, though!	1	4/5/2023
DNCE007	5.00	Professor Reynoso is extremely passionate about the topic which is great, but sometimes he expects you to know as much as he does. During his lectures, he presents slides with A LOT of important information, but it is kind of messy and hard to read. he also mumbles a lot so its sometimes hard to understand what he is saying and he really dislikes it when people use their phones so don't expect to be able to use your phone or any electronics at all. he assigns readings but he goes over them in class, but sometimes he makes you discuss with you neighbor. There is 1 midterm, 1 paper, and 1 final. 	6	11/5/2019
		Taken Fall 2022 with Shea Murphy; lotsss of writing (essays, ejournals, discussion responses, etc.) and it's very time-consuming. The content was interesting though and it's manageable. 	4	3/13/2023
DNCE007W	4.50	Lots of essays so just be sure to pace yourself. Its nice that you can write about what you like so long as you meet the requirements. There is a required workshop that takes place every other week I believe. The class tutor didn't help me at all so I would definitely recommend going to ARC if you need a tutor/someone to help you with the essays.	8	9/10/2020
		took with anthea kraut. i took it online wint quarter of 2021. so easy sll you had to do was write and be super descriptive of dance moves. you write a big paper at the end but you work on it throughout the whole quarter and u focus on one dance sequence of your choice. 	1	5/31/2022
DNCE065A	3.00	Intro to latin dance. Easy A. Just show up and dance. Very enjoyable even if you never dance before 	3	3/23/2019
ECON002	3.92	Pretty basic intro to econ class. Had a good TA so discussion was helpful	5	3/28/2017
		It's a basic econ course. I took the class with Matt Lang. Lang replaces your quiz scores with your midterm if you do better and adds more weight to you final if you do better on it than your midterm. He doesn't curve though. If you put actual effort into the class, it should be an easy A. I only studied the day before each exams so I only got an A-.	4	6/16/2018
		The class was straightforward. Pay attention in class and you should be fine. Look over the notes every now and then to make sure you understand all of it. Class is exam heavy but can be replaced. Do homework ahead of time and understanding questions makes it easier. TAs helps to clarify material. 	6	8/24/2018
		If you can, always try to take it with Lang! Doesn't require you to buy a physical textbook (an additional $10 if you want), but does require you to purchase a TopHat subscription (basically an online version of the clickers and it counts toward your grade). Attendance in this class is crucial to your success since everything he talks about is literally on the exam (unless you have the textbook, then you might be set for the class). All of the exams are multiple choice and are very similar to the homework problems. So do your homework problems as practice before the exam! (He gives you unlimited attempts for homework problems as long as you do them before the deadline, so you have no excuse to not get a 100% in that category for the class!) Can't use a graphing calculator in class so be sure to have a scientific calculator for the calculations. 	3	12/14/2018
		Lang is a really great teacher! go to class, get tophat points and take better and more concise notes after lecture. Do well on both midterms so you dont have to worry about your grade later because he veers of the grading stated on the syllabus. And it kinda gets messy at the end	6	3/23/2019
		Matthew Lang does a great job in explaining concepts, and if you pay attention all of his exams are pretty easy. Highly recommend taking this class if he's teaching it.	2	3/26/2019
		joab, a bit harder than econ003 but still the same	4	6/4/2019
		Lang - get the book, it's 10 bucks with top hat added on, really worth it because he basically covers the lectures from there, so if u miss class the book suffices. Also, the exams are all MCs so less room for error. If u study book thoroughly, hw questions, and tophat qs, should be fine	4	6/15/2019
		Had Matt Lang for Econ, and he's a very good professor. Makes the class a fun environment to learn, highly recommend reading his textbook (it's a very easy read) to secure that A. Other than that, if you pay attention in class you will do fine. 	3	5/18/2020
		Make sure you listen to to the lectures and you will be good to go for the class.	5	6/12/2020
		Took it online with Prof Lang. Easy to pass with A if you do the work. One midterm and one cumulative final, all open notes. 4/7 lecture quizzes need to be passed with at least 80%. 4/8 discussion questions need to be done prior to discussion. 3 homework assignments. He also posts his recorded lectures on YouTube. Highly recommended. 	4	7/1/2020
		Not a very hard class, Joab Corey is an excellent professor, probably one of the best I've had in lower div classes at UCR. Got a 98.25% in the class and it was my least busiest class the whole quarter.	3	12/21/2020
		Took it with Prof Joab Corey Fall 2020 pandemic. Prof is readily available to help and the course itself was pretty easy. There were 2 midterms, 1 final, and weekly modules and all of them were pretty easy. There is a lot of opportunity for extra credit. 	2	12/28/2020
		Took this with Joab. Amazing professor. Very organized. Knows how to explain economics really well. Offers a lot of extra credit and a lot of extra practice and review for tests. Highly recommend! 	2	12/28/2020
		Professor Lang is super chill and accommodates to the best he can for the pandemic. The class overall was easy, one midterm one final, half of the weekly quizzes and discussion activities were dropped as well. Everything was on tophat and he even negotiated with them to give us a lower price for it.	4	3/18/2021
		Took it with Matthew Lang. Material is made easy to understand. The class is made very fun and entertaining. The only manditory work is to complete 5/8 lecture quizzes, 4/8 discussion activities, the midterm(30 multiple choice), and final (50 multiple choice). Take good notes and familiarize yourself with the formulas and you will pass no problem. 	3	3/25/2021
		Took with Lang during Covid Winter 2021. The class was pretty easy and his lectures were live. You have to buy tophat but it comes with his textbook which is optional to read (but I recommend reading it since he uses questions from the textbook for quizzes sometimes). Midterm and Final are open note and not proctored, and I'd recommend going over the textbook before taking the exams. 	3	3/29/2021
		Super easy with McLaren, just really boring	2	5/22/2021
		Took it 2021 FALL online: You need to study and go to lecture. Matthew lang is nice but there are definitely works you need to do. He might curve the final depend on the performance of the class. This class is cool, recommend for general educationt	4	12/13/2021
		"Took with Matt Lang Winter 2022. People say he's an amazing professor, and he is great, though I think he's overhyped. It's extremely easy to pass as a lot of quizzes and assignments are dropped. There's also minimal homework as other reviews have said. Personally, I thought his lecture notes were a bit messy and it was hard to know what was considered ""important"" or what he thought was just ""fun facts."" I personally wish he would've specified ""this is important to know"" during his lectures. It also may be easy to pass, but it is difficult to get an A as he doesn't round grades because of his generous grading. Overall an easy class, but final grades/midterms determines a chunk of your score.  "	3	3/18/2022
		Matt Lang is an amazing professor! He is funny and laid-back, and one of the best professors I've had. However, the course material is really difficult to grasp, especially if you're not naturally strong in STEM. I was expecting the course to be an easy A, but the exams were hard and I ended up with a B. 	8	3/24/2022
		Very easy class if you pay attention and take notes. Joab care's a tremendous amount about his students and puts in a lot of effort to have things run smoothly. 10/10 recommend. 	5	11/11/2022
ECON003	3.83	Easy A if you pay attention and study. I did my studying last minute and never went to lecture so I got a C+	4	7/1/2017
		Bree Lang is pretty easy. Her homework assignments are almost exactly like her exams.	4	10/1/2017
		The class is relatively easy. Pay attention and review every so often to retain material. As long as you complete homework on your own and understand the topics it should be straightforward. The exams were relatively from the material and were not to difficult. If you feel lost, TAs are helpful in getting you back on track. Homework and Test heavy. 	3	8/24/2018
		Definitely take this with Joab Corey if you can, he keeps every lecture interesting/funny and explains all the topics really really well. Go to all lectures for sure, there's transmitter questions for points during every class + without showing up for notes it'll be almost impossible to pass	6	3/27/2019
		Bree Lang is nice, is pretty straightforward. Her exam questions are not. She will trick you into thinking answers. Read everything carefully	6	5/29/2019
		Joab was easy, first midterm is just like ECON002 which is easy. after first midterm you kinda have to pay attention one topic is similar to the next	3	6/4/2019
		Bree Lang is so nice! Take it with her since you will definitely enjoy the class. However, the grade for the course is weighted extremely heavily on exams so participation and homework barely bumps your grade. Exams are tricky but doable. Discussion sections are optional so you can ditch if u want.	4	6/16/2019
		Took it with Professor Bree Lang. She’s super nice, but no curve or extra credit. Has unlimited tries on homework so you can’t get below a 100 and it’s basically a free class; she doesn’t use textbooks or top hat. Understood everything in class but the homework, midterms and finals are really hard because of the wording. She gives you a practice exam before every exam but the practice doesn’t cover everything on the final, so good luck studying with no extra materials. Discussions are optional. 	7	12/17/2019
		Bree Lang is one of the best teachers ever! she doesn't curve, but she does update grades quite frequently and she makes learning fun. Her tests are similar to the homework's, but still study. Exam 1 is a breeze, exam 2 : study more, and as for your Final: says 50/50, but chapter 8 and 9 are heavily emphasized!!!!!	3	12/18/2019
		I like how professor Bree is always enthusiastic in lecture. This is not a hard class if you put in the effort and stay on top of it. However, the exam questions can be tricky and because I haven't really paid attention to this class, I struggled a little. No curves and no extra credits were offered	4	12/19/2019
		"I took this class with prof Bree Lang. She was a phenomenal professor, with a clear enthusiasm for teaching. The subject matter can be a bit tricky at times, but she's very responsive on explaining things on the class discussion board. Attendance is mandatory in lecture as we have ""clicker"" questions. Her midterms are pretty straightforward, the best way to study for them is to study the clicker questions, homework, slides, and practice midterms that she posts. I got a 92.75 in the class, which is technically an A-minus, but she curved me up to an A :)"	5	2/3/2020
		[COVID-19 ERA] Class wasn't too bad before the midterm, really picked up after the midterm. Bree Lang is an amazing, understanding professor and I would definitely recommend her, it was a superb class.	4	6/11/2020
		lots of “work” but it’s actually just a few homeworks, lecture quizzes, and easy discussion assignments. These take very little time. the material is easy, Bree Lang is a fantastic teacher. she’s very compassionate. I’m just a little upset my 99 counted as an A and not A+ lmao. 	3	6/18/2020
		Professor Joab Corey is one of my favorite teachers. As a CHASS student, econ isn't a favorite subject of mine but he has everything asynchronous, super detailed videos, and is great at teaching. 	4	2/2/2021
		With Professor Joab it's super easy especially during the pandemic. open note tests, 2 mid terms, one final his lectures are so easy to follow i suggest taking notes as you watch and it says three times a week, but everything is recorded and he's super chill and easy to talk to YOU WON'T REGRET IT	2	2/24/2021
		I took it with Joab Corey and he is such a great professor! He makes all the concepts easy to understand and is always available to help. There's weekly modules that need to be completed with 2 quizzes, but you can use your notes on all the quizzes. 2 midterms and a final that weren't too bad. He has good grading policies too. 	4	3/19/2021
		Take with Joab Corey if you can. Its completely asynchronous with some optional review sessions you can go to if you need help. He's very accomodating to his students. I was supposed to take 3 finals in 1 day but he let me push the final back to another day. Module and discussion quizzes are easy enough. Watch a couple lecture videos and you'll be fine.	2	3/23/2021
		I took this class during COVID with Professor Joab Corey. You can tell that he's passionate about the material and cares a lot about his students. There were weekly quizzes, but you could use your notes for those. The 2 midterms and the final had questions similar to the quizzes and the practice exams he gave us. As long as you keep up with the lectures and take notes, you will most likely get and A. I also took the honors version of this class (ECON003H), and that just has essays every 2 weeks and a book project at the end. The essays and book project were super easy (i'm pretty sure he gave everyone 100s on them).	3	3/25/2021
		I took this class with prof Joab and I can honestly say he was the best Econ teacher I've ever had. He makes the material very easy to understand for it being online and his classes and discussions are asynchronous. Workload consists of weekly quizzes and discussion modules and the exams which are all fairly easy. Definitely recommend taking with him! 	4	6/1/2021
		I took this class with Bree Lang and she was super kind and connected really well with her students. It was obvious that she really cared about helping us get a good grade. The major assignments in this class was broken into the categories of: Discussion assignments, Lecture quizzes, midterm (only 1), final. For the discussion assignments, if you get 20/40, she considers it full credit while for the lecture quizzes (8 in total), she considers 50/80 full credit. I struggled a bit in this class because you really need to be careful with reading the questions and you need to have good reading comprehension to not make mistakes. I got a D on the midterm but for the final I got a B and eventually passed with a B+ so even if you don't do well on the midterm, just make sure you get full credit of the LQ's and the DS's. Every exam was open notes too. 	6	6/10/2021
		Coming from a POSC/AS student, Economics is really boring LOL. But Joab Corey makes the class as interesting as he can by putting pop culture references or letting you watch movie clips to better understand the information. Lecture was in person but also asynchronous. I heard no one really went to class in person though. Asynchronous really helped because I was not willing to wake up at 9 for a 10am class LOL. Overall, good teacher, just really boring material that he tries to make up with pop culture jokes LOL. I feel like he actually cares about his students too. 	7	2/23/2022
		Winter 2022, Take with Joab very understanding professor. Every was on quizlet when it was online. 	2	3/19/2022
		"Took Bree Lang. There are 8 quizzes worth 10 points each (you only need to get 50 points total to get full credit for the quizzes), 4 discussion assignments worth 10 points each(only need 20 points total to get full credit), a midterm, and final. There is also free ""good citizen"" points - don't disrespect other studends and you get the points. Lecture, slides, and notes are all posted to elearn - attendance during live lecture is not manditory. Bree Lang is very nice but during our class we were always falling behind schedule because she constantly got side tracked and off topic."	6	5/27/2022
		By far the easiest class I've ever taken at UCR. Just find two-three friends to take this class with who can help you out, and poof! You get an easy A. Definitely recommended as a breadth course for CS majors.	1	8/22/2022
		Joab Corey is a very understanding and kind professor. He makes himself available to students and provides a lot of opportunities for you to succeed. The concepts are not too hard to understand, especially if you have taken macro econ before. Joab designs the class to also be asynchronous if you want to, but I always found it better to attend in-person lectures. Very interesting concepts and ideas and you can learn a lot with effort! Tests and quizes may have multiple attempts and should not be too difficult with all the review materials he provides.	4	4/2/2023
ECON003H	1.00	Took this with Joab during COVID, he is an amazing professor! He is truly passionate about the subject and enjoys teaching it which makes lectures interesting and easy to follow. Content is easy to understand and he was very understanding of the online environment. Honor students took the same class as non honors but had additional writing assignments which were just reading analyses that were not bad at all. Would definitely take this class again, Joab is a a great professor!	1	3/28/2021
ECON006	4.67	w/ Foster. Lecture slides appear on iLearn the day of, and he makes a study guide for the final	4	12/15/2018
		6 Problems Sets (1 Drop), Clickers via Kahoot, 1 Midterm, 1 Final. Most of the class was easy. Final was hard to study. Very generous curve.	5	12/16/2018
		Dr. Tellez Foster is a very passionate and engaging teacher but fuck me, the material is very hard to self-study for and the textbook is sooo boring. Make sure to go to his study sessions.	5	1/1/2020
ECON101	5.80	Prof. Matt Lang teaches this (Fall 2018) - get him if he is teaching it. Sure, it's an upper division class which is why it's rated on the higher end. But if you have taken STAT 048, you should be fine. Other than that, you would only need to study a night or two before the exams to do well (noted that you have paid attention in class - you can search on YouTube for how to do the statistical part). However, showing up for the lab and discussion portions are  mandatory as attendance and assignments in these sections count towards your final grade. 	7	1/29/2019
		Professor Vel. Really easy teacher one midterm one final and the rest of the grade is based on discussion and lab. Not hard it’s basically an intro stats class so if you have taken stats before you should do well.	3	5/26/2020
		Took with Tae-Hwy Lee, attendance is not mandatory nor does it help.  Professor mumbles and his notes are pretty difficult to follow along. Discussion and lab helped a lot since all the TA's went through almost every homework problem.  Material is pretty easy, the textbook isn't the greatest, but using Google/YouTube should help.  The class was also curved heavily, one midterm and final.	5	8/10/2022
		Very statistically focused, but you dont really feel any economics lol, I dont think we talked about economics at all. Wouldn't suggest if youre not a econ major or if you dont care/need about statistical models( p-value, z score, etc.)	7	12/7/2022
		I took this course with Veronica Sovero in the Fall of 2022. There is 1 midterm and 1 final, which aren't too difficult. Most of the class is graded on easy weekly labs and 2 lecture quizzes per week. Make sure you do well on them because some of them can get pretty hard. The final was curved a little bit. Keep in mind that Veronica is a new professor at UCR, so she might switch up some of her methods. I ended the class with an A-, which I thought was fair since I got a C on the final. 	7	12/13/2022
ECON102	3.00	Take with McLaren! 2 midterms, 3 homeworks, and 1 final. All are short worksheets that you can take on your own but within the time frame. Also really appreciate how he added the video recordings to the elearn! attendance is not mandatory and the exams are based off of the homework! Thank you professor McLaren for an understandable easy class! 	3	6/7/2022
ECON103	6.13	-professor Ortego Marti - Hw weekly - 1 midterm - 1 Final. Midterm is doable with a lot of studying , Final is very hard . There is a curve at the end.	7	3/31/2017
		First midterm was hard but the TA's really helped afterwords. For the rest of the midterms/finals most of the questions were based off the practice questions he gave out so it was pretty easy to get an A. Lectures were not that useful and were in the UV for me. Professor was Silvitu.	6	12/13/2019
		Professor Kenneth Kim-- Honestly, very difficult class and Prof. Kim did not make it any easier... He's bad at controlling a class and jokes around TOO much at times. Hard to take him seriously, which doesn't help you with grasping the material as he reads off his slides. Yes, he does homework examples in class, but even then he incorporates a joke or two. *Need the book for homework*	8	2/26/2019
		Had Prof. George Sarraf - class should be alright if you pay attention in lecture and properly (they post answer keys and chegg has everything ofc) do the homework assignments. There are only 3 hw assignments throughout the quarter, but they're pretty lengthy, so I suggest you start early if you have Sarraf. He has an accent, but it isn't too bad, and he likes to crack jokes. There's 2 midterms and a final during week 10 that is not cumulative. He uploads the slides and likes to write on one side of the white board in Life Sciences so it pretty much made people not attend lecture. He mentioned that only 30% of the class shows up in lecture so he doesn't think the class deserves a curve.	7	6/16/2019
		Class was hard due to being online and lectures pre recorded. Lectures did not help on the midterm nor final.	8	12/28/2020
		Intermediate macro with Abubaker. 1 midterm, 1 final. Very short hw assignments every couple weeks. Prof has no structure to the class. In-person lectures are not worth it. Go to discussion, do the hw, and go to 1-2 classes before the exams for review sessions and you’ll be set. 	3	3/8/2023
ECON104A	6.00	The professor was very nice and understanding but the material was math based and challenging. 	8	4/3/2017
		Took Fall 2019 with Urmee Khan. The material can be challenging and the class could be much harder, but the professor makes the exams a lot easier then they could be. I went into the class not knowing much about calculus but was still able to get an A in the class. The professors teaching style is hard to follow along to, and I learned mostly from the lecture slides and discussions. The most important thing about this class to succeed is to do the practice problems and understand what's going on when you do the homework. The exams are almost identical to the sample ones given.	5	12/17/2019
		(Urmee Khan - Fall 2020) - she is literally the worst professor I've ever met.  Her handwriting is absolutely atrocious, it is extremely difficult to read what she is writing in her recorded lectures (she has a thick accent as well).  For a week, we didn't have live lectures because her computer broke and it took ages for her new one to come in.  I stopped going to lecture because it took too much effort to read what she was writing and I was learning more through YouTube/self studying.  She made the entire class buy Pearson ($100) for homework and only assigned 4 assignments throughout the entire quarter (the last two assignments were given out at the 2nd to last week of the quarter).  Her mid-term was pretty easy, but her final literally bent everyone over (she left the country almost two weeks before the final, no live lectures during this period).   If you do not have a steady foundation in Calc, do not take her.  	7	12/15/2020
		I took this course with Bree Lang in the Winter of 2022. This class is a more in-depth look at what you learned in Micro Econ principles, but with more math. A lot of students had issues with the calculus that was taught, but if you ask questions during lecture/discussion, you should be okay. While the exams were open note and online, she made sure they were more conceptual and difficult. Still, Bree Lang is a very approachable professor. I ended the course with an A-. 	7	3/22/2022
		Had some slight derivatives, but they are not like in calc class, way easier. Teacher was Bree Lang, she was super helpful and enthusiastic. I said in the discord that I was sad that the final was very soon after my other final that day(literally 30 min) and without asking she offered to delay it another 30 so I could relax and prep between them. Class is easy if you study well enough, and I would argue anyone could get a B in this class	7	5/27/2022
ECON104B	6.00	Pay attention in class, homework assignment every week, can find it online. Before Midterm  has a review session which is practically the exam, so attend it. Final is cumulative but the questions are from his homework assignments. The Final is multiple choice, true and false with explanation and mathematical questions(the HW but numbers changed) 	5	3/29/2020
		I took this class with Bandy during covid and it was the worst Economics class I have taken so far at UCR. I am an economics major and I swear he was so unorganized. His tests were very hard and he thought since he can do them in 10 minutes we should be able to do them in 50 minutes. If someone does not know how to teach themselves they will not know what is going on in this class. I got a good grade in the end because everyone complained and he curved the class so he wouldn't fail everyone. But I am a good student and this class would have ruined my record. I know this is supposed to be one of the hardest classes but I can't help but feel that if B. Lang was teaching it, it would have been easy yet hard. 	7	5/25/2021
ECON105A	4.75	Had Professor Guo. Attend his lectures. That's what's key to getting an A. He drops key information and test questions in his lecture. Also he give worksheets which are the exams split up. If you practice the worksheets. You'll do great on the midterms. There's 2 midterms and the final	6	5/8/2020
		Fall 2021 (Online), Prof. Lee - Pretty easy class, most of his problem sets were online and midterm/final were open book.  Attendance was not required and problem sets carried my grade.  There is also a paper due near the end of the quarter, basically BS'd it and got a 91%	4	2/2/2022
		"I took this course with Dong Lee in the Fall of 2022. There is 1 midterm, 1 final, and a short paper due at the end of the quarter. The exams for the class were difficult, and the average score for the midterm and final was an F. Thankfully, he curves the final grade of the class. The team-project paper is super easy and it's pretty much a grade-booster. The homework sets were pretty straight forward, and accounted for a decent percentage of the final grade. I ended the class with an A+. 
"	6	12/14/2022
		Had with Prof. Dongwon Lee, lectures can be pretty boring as he goes off the slides. He does go over problems that are very similar to what is shown on the exams. Class covers the same concepts as intro macro with slightly more math (nothing more advanced than algebra). The curve is also set so that the average student gets a B. Grade is 30% midterm, 30% final, 30% hw, and 10% a term paper.	3	12/19/2022
ECON105B	5.75	Took with Lee Dongwon. His lectures made me feel  sleepy lol, but he uploads his notes and they are really great, I can always understand whats in the problem sets when I find the correct notes. 5 problem sets with one  being dropped, a term paper, and midterm and final. Everything is based on curve.	7	12/7/2022
		Avoid Professor Riyad Abubaker - his lectures are incredibly difficult to follow along, the slides consist of vague graphs and he would write notes on the whiteboard with messy/small handwriting.  If you have to take him, you'll need to put in some effort self-studying.	7	3/12/2023
		I took this course with Riyad Abubaker in the Winter of 2023. The class isn’t really too difficult, but the professor isn’t amazing. He hardly goes over notes during lectures and usually spends a ton of time just telling stories. There is one midterm and a final, both of which make up a substantial part of your final grade. Just make sure you go to discussion and office hours if you don’t understand something in the class. I finished with an A-. 	6	4/3/2023
		Topics aren't super hard, took it with Abubaker and he barely taught. The TAs covered the problems and concepts you need to know and the professor also basically tells you what is going to be covered on the midterm and final. If you take the time to review the material and do a couple practice problems the course is very easy. 	3	4/5/2023
ECON107	5.33	Professor Shi kind of boring and lectures make you want to sleep. The material is really hard.	6	5/26/2020
		Took w/ Professor Ozkan Eren - he seems passionate about the class but it was difficult to understand him at times, he sometimes speaks so fast I had no clue what he said.  He will go over 1-2 questions from the midterm/final during lecture (at random times, but before the actual exam).  Lab and discussions helped in understanding the homework, but pay attention to what prof. looks for during lecture examples - simply answering the question isn't enough.  STATA was also used in lab, but my instructor never really went over code; he handed us everything.  Final is not cumulative and blue books for required for both midterm/final. 	5	12/19/2022
		I took this course with Ozkan Eren in the Winter of 2023. I thought that this class was going to be difficult, but the professor made it very manageable. In discussions and labs, the TAs basically gave out the answers for the homework assignments. We also used STATA in this class, but you don’t need any prior experience to understand it. The midterm was easy, but the final was much more difficult. Thankfully, he curved both exams. Overall, I got an A in the class. 	5	4/3/2023
ECON124A	5.00	Took it with Jeff Allen. Very straightforward class, just remember the major events and how they connect to global economic development. His tests are a bit picky in that he wants detailed answers(free response) and to clearly demonstrate your understanding of the event. Would take again	5	9/8/2022
ECON129	5.00	"Health Economic with Matt Lang the material is not hard he only had 4 quizzes, a midterms
 and a final. Just remembering how the graphs move and why is super important.  "	5	5/26/2020
ECON130	6.00	"Took with Kenneth Kim during Fall '22 (in-person).  Probably the worst professor I have ever seen in Economics, lecture compromises of 50+ slides that are copied/pasted from the textbook.  During lecture, he glances over all the slides giving vague information to each new topic presented to class.  He goes off on a tangent frequently and does NOT give a clear direction when it comes to the material covered.  When asked about what would be covered on the midterm, he mumbled and told the class to study ""everything"".  He gave a key term guide (100+ key terms) a day before the midterm when he could have given it a week before and reviewed it instead of wasting our time with the pointless slides.  Midterm consisted of multiple choice questions from our weekly quizzes and FRQs from practice sets that were given out as class work practice.  Take another class to fill the requirement, it isn't worth the headache to take this class with him."	6	12/3/2022
ECON135	6.00	"It's the stock market class (business elective) with Professor Silviu Velovici. It's kind of hard to say how difficult the class is due to the project that he gave us last minute. Cheat sheets are allowed for the two midterms and the final. The midterms are based on the homework, but he switches the questions slightly (ex: ""increase"" from homework to ""decrease"" on midterm). It's basically a class with a lot of accounting stuff. He came up with a group project the Monday before Thanksgiving break, so we had to find group members outside of class and not within our discussion. So many people sent out emails to find a group and other members, so it probably delayed a lot of people in starting it. Since it was so last minute I thought it was pretty disorganized - I'm pretty sure no one wants to finish up a project during their break. The final ended up being based on the project, so just doing your part in the project probably wouldn't have been enough to know everything. It was decided that he was going to take the 3 best grades out of 2 midterms, the project, and the final. So make sure you do well on at least 3 of those. I think it's a class worth looking at, but the best experience would be going to lecture and actually knowing all the material for the group project if he decides to do it again. He's a pretty cool and funny guy - since very few people showed up to the lecture right before Thanksgiving he gave out some extra credit. "	6	12/14/2019
ECON143	3.00	Joab Corey’s an interesting and fun teacher, relatively easy class, no discussion section! 	3	4/11/2019
ECON160	7.00	Took it with Kenneth Kim. Course was heavy on math and required most econ knowledge from macro/micro. Dont reccomend taking it with him. Professor goes over slides very fast and does not have organized notes. Course will require reading textbook and individual study. Curve was big tho, most of class got C/D. 	7	9/12/2022
ECON162	6.67	The midterm and final was just the homework problems with numbers changed plus True/False explain questions that the professor mentions in review session. 	5	12/18/2017
		Quizzes every lecture, HW weekly, midterm, and final. Both exams were based on the homework	7	9/4/2020
		Try your best to avoid Bandy 	8	4/1/2021
ECON163	8.00	Avoid Urmee Khan - she is a nice professor, but her notes are difficult to follow along because of grammar/diction issues and the slides can sometimes be vague.  During lecture, she'll handwrite some notes on the board to explain more on vague slides and I found it difficult to follow because her handwriting is atrocious.  She created her own homework prompts, but the difficulty does not match the midterm or final (many were unprepared with some of the questions on exams).  This class requires constant self-study and going to class to ask questions is a must because her email response rate is poor.	8	3/18/2023
ECON171	6.50	Taken with Kenneth Kim. Easy A with the overall grade curve at the end but avoid if you aren't into the whole read off the slides for the entire lecture thing. Groups of 4-5 for both homework assignments during the quarter. One midterm and one final (cumulative). 	6	3/24/2022
		I took this class with Dongwon Lee Fall 2022 and Im ngl, this class was pretty hard. He grades your problem sets (they're usually due a week after being assigned) pretty harshly. We only had one midterm and one final AND THEYRE SUPER DIFFICULT. You would have to actually study for them and try in this class, but the good thing about this course is that he curves so nicely. I got like a 13/50 as my raw score on the midterm and passed the class with a B.	7	1/5/2023
ECON178	4.00	This class should be manageable if you take it with Bree Lang. She will most likely post lecture videos, slides,  and notes so that's a plus. You have to do reading assignments and lecture quizzes, but you don't have to get a perfect score in order to get full credit for them. To get a good grade on your midterm and final, I highly recommend doing the practice questions that she gives you. Good luck.	4	12/13/2021
EDUC005	2.75	Professor Gutierrez is super easy. No tests or quizzes. Just 2 two-page papers for homework and midterm and final are papers too. Lecture is just taking notes, but it's kinda useless and so are the readings.	1	11/21/2019
		(COVID time) I took it with Gutierrez and she's really nice but unorganized. I relied on the groupchat to help me and I heard she could take weeks to answer emails. No hw but readings every week. I stopped reading them cause she goes over it during lecture (optional) anyways. A few discussion questions every week since Discussion is basically office hours. 2 papers, 1 midterm research project, 1 final paper	3	12/9/2020
		PLEASE ATTEND. participation and attendance was worth 30% of my grade and was the only reason why I did not pass with an A. 	2	12/17/2021
EDUC010	1.50	Lussier was easy and wonderful. It's a pretty useful class. 	2	5/24/2019
		A high school freshman student could pass this class, it’s crazy to think I’m paying to take this class. It’s an easy and chill class about “learning strategies” (ex. Get a planner, have time management). The catch is the prof doesn’t post the slides so you do have to come and do the notes. However, the prof posts relevant study guides which makes things even easier. Consisted of a few small writing assignments with one large final writing prompt and 2 midterms with no real final.	1	6/15/2019
		Winter 2023 with Prof Lussier. All online. Randolph was my TA. This class is super easy but has a lot of busy work. A high schooler could pass this class, but honestly, this class was quite useless to me. It was a lot of generic information that a senior doesn't really need, it is more geared towards freshman. So if you are looking for an easy elective class I would recommend this class. 	1	3/8/2023
EDUC023	5.00	"Had this class online (all lectures recorded, discussion online). There are ""modules"" (lectures and readings) every week and at most 2 quizzes due every week. There are 2 projects, no essays or exams. "	5	11/2/2021
EDUC040	4.00	Taught by Begoña Echeverria who reminds me of a strict annoying high school teacher, the type who yells at you when your phone is out. One of the more “difficult” lower-div education classes, or for a better word tedious. It’s a lot of dense reading from a dry textbook about the history of education in the US, not that fun. Also, the class is mostly essay based, the prof even mentioned wanting to make it a WAC class. Wouldn’t recommend as an “easy class” unless you like history and writing. 	4	6/15/2019
EDUC042	2.00	"Super easy class, lectures are honestly optional, but are a lovely time. Dr. Lee's teaching style allows for everyone to participate and overall the most welcoming course I've ever taken. Weekly reading response assessments (which are 2/3 - 1 full page) about 2 articles read per week (1 scholarly one, 1 video/podcast/article that relates to real world). I had Sofia Rivera as my TA and I absolutely love her! Our biggest project is ""My Educational Journey"" where we read out loud in our discussion section about our educational journey, overal amazing way to see our differences in experience and just a great way to get to understand our SOE community at Riverside! "	2	3/1/2023
EDUC043	7.00	Begona was super confusing. She was very bias which sucked because there is so many other ways to teach educations history. the only grades youll get is an in person midterm, take home paper, and final. The readings are super long and boring! TA: rodaina really came through. 	7	6/7/2023
EDUC049	2.00	Crazy easy with Judith Kroll. Literally only went to class 6 times this quarter, got a C on the final, and received an A+ as my final grade.	2	12/16/2018
EDUC050	5.00	The class material is pretty interesting, it's about the NCAA and student athletes. There's a number of weekly assignments due on different days and times that can be a bit hard to keep up with unless you write them down/set reminders! The midterm wasn't too bad, the prof tells you what will be on it. There's a final paper due at  the end which is like 5-8 pages. 	5	12/28/2020
EDUC051	1.00	Took with Dr. Rall W22. Super easy class. She responds to emails fast. This class was async and we had weekly discussion boards on canvas and video quizzes. By far the easiest class I have taken. You learn a lot about the higher education system.	1	3l9l2022
EDUC061	3.25	Took it with Dr. Lussier. Overall, to me, I found this class really interesting. Dr. Lussier is funny, caring, and makes lecture interesting. I would recommend going to lectures because she will randomly give out worksheets, which counts as points. There's a poster-board project on your simulated child, that makes up majority of your grade, and you prepare for it throughout the quarter. If you keep up with the work, in the end, all you have to do is assemble your board. For the midterm and final, as long as you do the study guide she gives out, the midterm will be easy. Was suppose to have a final, but it was cancelled because of the coronavirus. Discussion sections are mandatory! 	2	3/29/2020
		easily one of the most interesting classes you'll ever take. I had dr. lussier, and she made everything really easy to understand and is very helpful with any questions you have. make sure you attend weekly discussions though because you do activities that will help for your final project (making a display board). but the prof and your ta will prepare you a lot for the project. midterms are very easy too, got As both times.	4	5/29/2020
		Professor Lussier is amazing! This class was super interesting, very engaging, and the work we did was easy and fun to do. I highly recommend. 	1	12/28/2020
		Really easy and enjoyable class if you go to class and take notes. Midterm and final are open-note and easy to pass if you have all of the notes and do the readings. 	2	3/7/2022
EDUC104	5.00	Took it with Wolf. She has a lot of weekly fluff assignments but doesn't grade them just for completion, so watch out for that. 	5	3/13/2020
EDUC105	3.00	Towne is a tough grader but the class is great and he is very passionate about teaching. You'll learn a lot and have fun. 	3	3/28/2018
EDUC122	1.00	Spring 23, asynchronous with Prof. Kahne. This class was super easy. The videos are easy to follow. Samia is a great TA. There are no group projects and the final is a 8-10 paged paper. Very easy class, you learn a lot about democracy in the classrooms. 	1	5/29/2023
EDUC150	2.00	Professor Comeaux Spring 22. Easy class. Pretty boring material unless you are into sports and college athletics. Lots of busy work but it is easy. One test and one essay for the final.	2	5/23/2022
EDUC152	3.00	Took with Professor Iglesias W22. Easy class, but it is a little unorganized. Online and lecture and discussion were mandatory. The TAs are very chill, my grade never dropped below an A. We had some discussion boards and small assignments here and there. We had 2 group projects for this class. Each one had 7 people in it. It was terrible. 	3	3/9/2022
EDUC154	3.00	Professor Iglesias. Spring 22. All online. Ari is a great TA. This class has 2 group projects but there is an opportunity to work independently. You can easily get an A for putting little effort. This class goes over DEI Initiatives. Pretty easy. She explains everything well	3	5/23/2022
EDUC162	3.00	taken Fall22 online Prof. Eui Kim. Group project for the final. Easy quizzes and discussion board assignments. Easy class, just the group project was very annoying. Lectures are painfully boring and attendance is mandatory. She is also very unorganized. Not the best, not the worst, just okay.	3	11/21/2022
EDUC184	7.00	Taken online Fall22 with prof. Rondy Yu. This class is harder than it looks. The quizzes are difficult. The midterm is a video you have to make which is easy. Anna was a great TA. But the lecture content is boring to sit through. All the other assignments like the discussion boards were easy. 	7	11/21/2022
EE001A	7.73	"Honestly this class should have been easy for me but it requires a lot of practice which I didn't do
If you find yourself having trouble just sit down and do A LOT of practice problems and you'll catch up, there isn't actually very much content to memorize and (at least when i took it) you are allowed to take notes to the final"	7	8/24/2018
		You need to do a lot of practice problems for this class. Make sure you have a good grasp on the analysis methods. This class doesn't require EE020 or a linear algebra equivalent as a prereq, so if you haven't taken EE020 like me you'll have to do some research on your own.	8	12/16/2018
		Practice, practice, practice. 	7	12/18/2018
		This class separates the EE boys from the non EE boys. I'm a CE major, but I seem to be inclined towards EE and circuitry, so I found the class to be average difficulty. If you know you aren't EE inclined, this will be hard AND EE001B will be even harder for you. However, if you take the time to understand the concepts in EE001A, EE001B will be a breeze.	8	2/13/2019
		Professor doesnt make sense 	8	6/16/2019
		Professor el-sharif really cares about his students and is quite funny too	5	12/10/2019
		El Sherief was a good professor. The HW is a good handout for grades, just make sure to check the answers before you turn it in because sometimes the graders are anal. Yanwei He is the chillest TA, so if you can switch into his lab (I did from Xi Ding's lab). The class and tests were graded pretty hard but if you keep up and practice DAILY I think it's really not that bad. The tests are a bit of a sucker punch, but make sure to stick to your guts and meet with the TAs to go over your mistakes.	6	1/6/2020
		(2020 Fall) EE001A will be hard for 99% of people. The average on our closed-note midterm was around a 35%. I'm sure the vast majority of professors end up curving. BIGGEST TIP: Do at least a few practice problems daily. There really isn't a lot of material, but most people struggle because they don't practice often or at all. Start doing this in the beginning of the quarter, and you should be set.	9	12/16/2020
		Make sure you practice nodal/mesh analysis A LOT!!!!!! I had Hossein Taheri, and the average on the midterm was a 40%. He made the final replace the midterm if it was better, effectively making the final worth 70% of your final grade. The class was terribly mismanaged, and it's a hard class to begin with.	9	12/22/2020
		If possible, do not take this class with Professor Taheri. He doesn't curve the midterm and made the final score replace the midterm score assuming you had a higher score. However, this barely helped students since the midterm and final problems were pulled from different textbooks. Homework and lecture questions and lecture slides were from the main textbook while the examinations were from a different textbook which has a different style of questioning and was not like the homeworks and the lectures. He ended up not curving any scores at all despite emails from students to the dean. 	9	5/22/2021
EE001B	6.60	Could have gone either way, if you did well in EE1A, and have grip on all the analysis methods, then it's walk in the park. 	5	11/15/2017
		Had it with Chomko. First half is easy. Second half is annoying, but doable. The biggest predictor of success is your 1A knowledge. If you have a solid foundation, a B or an A will be in your grasp.	4	12/23/2017
		Basically if EE001A was hard for you this class will make you want to die, but if you understood the material well it should be easy	5	8/24/2018
		If you came here because you thought EE001A was crazy hard and you are glad EE001B is easy, don't be fooled by the low score. The class IS easy IF you have a great grasp of the material in EE001A. If you are shaky on EE001A material you WILL struggle in this class. If you struggled in EE001A but did all the work and understand the concepts, then this class will be is a kiddie pool compared to EE001A. (Took w/ Sherif)	8	2/13/2019
		"Lecture was ok with Sherief but it was boring af. The lab goes off the 10 point scale for difficulty as it was out of sync with the class and had terms that we had never used before. The EE1A lab manual(Chomko wrote it) was god tier compared to this. No one ever got answers that agreed and the prelabs took longer than the labs themselves (not counting the time it takes to cram next week's chapter in order to do the prelab). Also the lab manual is old enough to vote next year. 
tldr; If you don't have Chegg, the lab will fuck you up."	10	3/23/2019
		This class is frustratingly difficult, I did okay in DC circuits, but AC circuits are in phasor dimension which although allows us to simplify some concepts from DC circuits to our gain, is really tough. It doesn't matter what teacher tbh, this class is just one of those super hard classes if you don't remember complex numbers or don't have a good grasp on DC circuit analysis concepts.	8	3/20/2020
		Took it with Navid during COVID. This class is more or less the same as EE001A but with Phasors. As long as you're ok at nodal/mesh analysis and thinking through an EE problem then you should be fine. Midterm/Final were hard but doable if you paid attention. As long as you take this class seriously you should pass. 	7	3/19/2021
		I had Navid Gharavi. He is a gem. He teaches extremely well, and you will genuinely feel like he is on your side. He encourages participation, and he gives extra credit for it and if you have your camera on [COVID era]. I felt terrible about EE in the beginning, but now I feel like a boss because of his class. You will have to put in effort though. But the experience is infinitely better than EE001A.	6	3/19/2021
		Easier than 001A. Navid is a great instructor and he does his best to answer all questions thoroughly in lecture. Labs were very poorly written and little support was available.	6	3/19/2021
		Had this class with Navid Gharavi. He teaches pretty well and pulls the midterms and finals from the textbook which is very helpful considering the homeworks and lectures are from the textbook as well so you are prepared for the types of questions. 	7	5/22/2021
EE003	10.00	Only one professor ever teaches this and he is pretty terrible at teaching this content. Test are like 200 questions	10	3/28/2017
EE010	1.80	There were no tests, but the professor gave homework that was not related to any of the learning we did, and was generally lazy. That said the guest speakers he brought in were interesting. Also there was a 2hr. workshop added that was run by IEEE	5	11/21/2017
		Literally a free A. 90% of the grade was attendance and the other 10% was like 4 10 minute homeworks. About half of the class is just listening to faculty talk about their research. Most of the EE material covered is stuff you should already know if you played with Arduino in high school. 	1	12/10/2019
		Didn't even show up and wrote the final essay drunk at a frat party. 	1	6/9/2023
EE016	9.00	"I took this class when it was offered for the first time, took it with Professor Samet Oymak.

The class is packed with information. We started from learning basic Python syntax, then into common searching and sorting algorithms, then recursion, then dynamic programming problems. We also learned a few important Python libraries such as Numpy and Matplotlib, and also Pandas. Midterm tests you on almost all of these things. In the second half of the course, we learned about linear regression which also introduced some Linear Algebra, Fourier transform which involved a little bit of signal stuff, introduction to Machine Learning using Scikit learn and uses MNIST as an example. Finally, we learned the basics of filtering noisy audio using FFT. Final focuses on linear regression and Fourier transform mainly. 

We had 5 assignments in total, the lowest one will be dropped. First 3 assignments each consisted of 8 questions, each one were like a Leetcode problem. Then, the 4th asks you to do some MNIST, the 5th asks you to use FFT to denoise images and audio.

The professor is nice, he is quite good at teaching, and according to him he likes to give a big curve at the end of the course to ensure most people pass, and half of the class should end up with A. I am not 100% confident on that yet, because at the time of me writing this, I haven't received my final grade yet. But, midterm and final were both pretty brutal, most classmates ended up getting around 30-50 out of 100 (110 effectively, 10 extra points) for the midterm.

Again, I took this class when it is first offered, so your experience may be completely different. However, I do suggest you to learn some of the things in this class beforehand, in case you get overwhelmed."	9	12/11/2022
EE020	5.77	Same as Math 31, Chomko normally teaches it (Hail Caesar Chomko). In lecture, you go over Linear Algebra. In lab, you go over Matlab with Zybooks. There's a quiz at the end of the Lab, but it was open note/book/internet.	4	6/15/2018
		First half of the class is simple enough. Just a copy of a past algebra class. The all of a sudden you start doing physics topics like vector addition. You literally tell from a specific homework that difficulty spikes out of nowhere. Then comes the final. The prof gives you a practice final but you shouldn't follow it at all. The final questions look nothing similar. It's more about actually learning the ins and outs of each topic he gave you. The wording is going to be completely different so that he can see who truly studied more than just a week. Basically it's a fuck you to everyone who thinks they should just do the practice final. 	8	6/15/2018
		First half of the class was extremely easy. The other half is way hard and requires studying to do decent on the final.	7	6/17/2018
		Basically a complete copy of Math031 content with the addition of MATLAB. Lecture essentially optional if you took Math031 already.	4	6/19/2018
		I took the class with Lindsey. First half is easy. Second half is harder, but it shouldn't too bad if you study seriously. For my quarter, the final was composed entirely of questions from the final review. The professor probably won't be doing that again but it might still be similar at least.	4	12/15/2018
		timothy lindsey. Honestly, don't even go to class. It's a waste of time. It's essentially a repeat of math31 with matlab. I took this last quarter senior year and like the prerequisites are cs10 and math 9a. Super easy. Terrible professor.	2	6/22/2019
		Ran Cheng is the shittiest prof I have ever had the displeasure of having at UCR. Extremely condescending towards question-asking and constantly glosses material.	7	5/27/2020
		Ran Cheng wasn't the best prof. Strongly suggest watching Youtube videos for help. Absolutely read the textbook. If you get and stay ahead of the class by one week, you'll be doing yourself a major favor.	8	10/8/2020
		I had Ceren Sevinc.  She is pretty nice and will give retakes on midterms. EE 020 is basically linear algebra and in the discussion you learn how to use MATLAB. The professor kinda just read off the slides and her internet quality was kinda bad so you couldn't really hear her. But the class as a whole is fairly easy. Just make sure to do your homework to get a good understanding. A lot of the questions on your homework are harder than the ones on the midterm and final. She gives out study guides in the same format as the midterm and finals. You use zybooks to learn MATLAB which is really good program if you've taken cs010A before. She also recorded all the lectures and uploads all the slides	6	12/14/2020
		Ran Cheng isn't that great of a professor and the examinations are pretty difficult. The homeworks are from the textbook which is manageable but YouTube videos are one of your best friends if you don't understand a concept.	7	5/22/2021
		"Ran Cheng has been the worst professor by far during my stay here. I consider myself a fast notetaker, but he goes over his slides in lectures too damn fast, to the point where no one is able to copy anything on the slides. He's more focused on getting through the slides to not ""fall behind"" on the material, rather than actually making sure his students understand the very concepts he's trying to teach. He doesn't answer chat questions, only hand raising (so rip if you don't have access to a microphone). He also only exclusively tests on proofs for his midterms and finals, which is not fun at all (our class average was around 40% for the midterm). In all complete honesty, I learned more from the 5 minute videos on YouTube than from his own lectures. Don't get me wrong, he seems like a nice dude, but, he DOES NOT know how to teach for his life. Avoid him at all costs."	8	6/8/2021
EE020B	4.00	Had Timothy Lindsey for Winter 2022. Really nice prof but extremely unorganized. The only thing most of my class knew how to do was Gaussian Elimination. Everything after that was really iffy. Only went to like 3 lectures but managed to get an A-. Apparently he's only failed like 1 person in the decade or so he's been teaching. Homework was optional (but he would look at it and determine if you were putting effort into the class if you needed a grade boost at the end) and there was a project where we literally just had to change the values of the graphs he already made. He emphasizes inclusivity for color blind people with all of his notes andd tells us to do the same in our project. Talks a lot about random stuff and is pretty chill.	4	4/20/2023
EE030A	7.50	Try to avoid Mihrimah Ozkan. I took this class with her and the average midterm score was 25%, with only 5 out of 110 students getting a passing score of over 70%. Her slides are a direct copy and paste from the textbook, and she reads off the slides like a high schooler giving a presentation. Offers little to no valuable teachings about how to solve a given problem. Claims to also have 21 years of experience but my classmates and I cannot find her on ratemyprof, and one of the ECE professors I am doing research with says they have never heard of Ozkan before. Questionable reliability. 	8	11/7/2022
		"I took it with Ozkan, Fall 2022. First half of quarter is where most people drop out because of network theorems, just get through it and try not to get discouraged. However, after midterm 1 the content is fine. Our prof wasn't good at teaching so i stopped going to class after week 2, looked at slides and wrote my own notes, and I was fine in the class, aka A+ final grade. 

Midterm 1 Avg: 25/100 and Midterm 2 Avg: 85/100. Midterm 1 was so bad that the prof was shocked at our scores and decided to drop it from the grading. Midterm 2 and Final were chill cause the prof felt sorry for midterm 1 lol. Also our score for the final didn't come out, final grades were just posted to transcript. For midterms/final just really understand ALL the steps being done in each prob on hw thats covered.  I would rate the class a solid 7, cause the network theorems was a 8 and everything else was a 6."	7	12/22/2022
EE100A	5.60	Although challenging, it's definitely easier the first few EE courses. Understand BJTs and MOSFETs thoroughly. You'll be using the same equations all throughout the class, but knowing when to apply them is when it gets tricky. Took with Ming Liu (Spring 2021), and it was a somewhat enjoyable experience. He's a good prof.	7	6/9/2021
		90% of the class is about various kinds of transistors. There's only like ~10 equations you need to know in order to solve most problems as long as you know how to apply them. Ming Liu's tests were harder than anticipated but he grades very generously. 	5	6/16/2021
		Took with Ming Liu Winter 2021. It's easier than the lower division EE courses in my opinion. It's just about transistors the whole time, BJTs and MOSFETs aren't the same thing but after learning the formulas they might as well be. Prof. Liu is pretty nice too, always stops to answer questions even if it's week 9 and you should have learned the answer in EE1A. He knows class isn't the most interesting thing so it's nice that he was pretty laidback and cracked jokes or shared some interesting news.	5	11/7/2021
		Took this class during Spring 2022 with Ming Liu, as the others said, it is a pretty laid back class. Practice midterms helped a lot, make sure to study those. Doing the labs was the hardest part of this class, they usually take up the whole lab time. 	5	6/15/2022
EE100B	6.00	Took with Roman Chomko Summer A 2020. He expects a lot from you, but never to the point that it's too much. The first week was a recap of all the prerequisite stuff you should know already partially because you might have forgotten and partially because he genuinely seems to think that the other EE professors' teaching is insufficient. The circuits you study and have to build in lab are pretty interesting.	7	11/7/2021
		This class is one of the more important ones you will take as an EE student. It covers circuits that you will actually deal with in your job as opposed to the watered down stuff from earlier courses. They look complicated but most of the time you can solve them as long as you have the right formulas. Ming Liu is a really forgiving grader and gives a lot of partial credit so make sure to attempt every problem on exams.  	5	3/17/2022
EE105	7.67	"A wholly miserable time. Skip out on lecture and you're pretty screwed, unless you take to reading the book. Exams aren't especially hard, but they're a serious time crunch, moreso than any other class in the major. There has yet to be someone who has turned in an exam early. Moreover, Jay's strict homework policy combined with his ingenious idea of MULTIPLYING quiz grades with their respective homeworks is a recipe for trouble. Even if you get a 100% on the homework, if you mess up a quiz and get, say, a 50% on it, you get a 50% overall on both the homework and the quiz. On the other hand, if you miss a homework and ace a quiz, you still get a 0 on both. 0 times 100 is still 0, unfortunately.

Labs are absolutely terrible. Not much I can do to help you there. Have fun.

Also, there is absolutely NO CURVE in the class. What you see is what you get. "	9	3/1/2019
		Do lab assignments ahead of time and carefully study the hw.	7	3/24/2019
		The homework and labs are difficult which gives a great opportunity to reach out to Jay and the TAs for help - they are willing and available to help you. Going to lecture is pretty important because that's when he goes through all the key examples. His lecture notes are an incredible resource. If you like to skip class and put in the bare minimum, you probably wont enjoy or do well in this course. If you ask questions and put in the effort to learn then you will be successful. 	7	12/21/2020
EE110A	4.50	Had Prof Shaolei Ren in 2019. Material is not that dense but it is critical for EE 110B. He curved individual exams heavy and allowed cheat sheets.	4	3/5/2020
		Had it with Professor Shaolei Ren in 2022, the grading style is very gentle, and professor likes to work through examples in class. The content was a bit abstract to me, but I believe the workload is light.	5	12/11/2022
EE110B	7.00	This class is basically a deeper dive into the content from EE110A focusing on concepts that come up in signal processing. It's super abstract with relatively little explicit discussion of actual circuits so if you're more of a physical thinker you may have a tougher time. Prof. Hua lectures by just writing shit on the board for 50 mins so his lectures were pretty sparsely attended. 	7	3/17/2022
EE111	5.00	Took with Sheldon, two midterms and final. Midterms were easy, but very hard final. Look at the lecture slides and use the lecture recordings. Labs were annoying to do, but the TA helps.	5	4/6/2023
EE114	5.00	Basically just a statistics class cosplaying as an EE class. It's mostly straight math. First half is super easy basic probability but it ramps up in the second half. Overall not that bad if you get the concepts. 	5	3/17/2022
EE115	8.00	Took with Matt Vaezi Summer A 2021. Vaezi is a passionate educator, but I get the feeling he is not formally trained. He is pretty unorganized and he showed up for lecture in-between meetings. He literally goes to work at his main job and lectures when he has time to take a break. It was hard to connect the high-level concepts in lecture and the math heavy homework. Everyone bombed the midterm so he made the final have as little math as possible. Labs were pretty informative though. 	8	11/7/2021
EE116	8.00	"The grading is so strict and you can seldom get the score if you made any mistakes in the tests. Whats more when you solved the questions by the steps according to the step learned from class, it failed. 
And for now the final score have been posted but the quiz and homeworks' score still unavailable.
All course material are handwritten papers and no more examples for the problems. 
If you really care your GPA i don't suggest it. "	10	12/22/2020
		The grading is strict but there will have curve and what you get will be pretty much better than what you see. 	6	12/31/2020
EE120A	4.50	First half of the course is essentially CS061 material, while second half gets slightly rough due to HLSM, etc.	7	3/29/2017
		If you did well in CS061, you'll probably do fine here. The labs can be very unfun, but still better than CS061 labs.	3	3/8/2018
		The first half of the course is essentially a repeat of CS61. The second half though gets more difficult with RTL and HLSM. We were allowed a cheat sheet for the midterm and final. The labs are written in Verilog, which honestly was the toughest part of the class. Verilog is no fun and they throw it at you expecting to know a lot right off the bat. Luckily the TA for our labs provided code for us to use. Homework was taken from the textbook. It starts off easy but midway through starts to slog. Make sure to pay attention or the final won't make sense!	7	3/23/2018
		Labs are tedious but doable. Midterm is pretty similar to hw. However, the final was the hardest cause the grader was not liberal in terms of partial credit.	6	5/25/2018
		Took this with Qi Zhu. Class is extremely easy, basically just copy and paste CS61 content for the first half. In the latter half, the class is a little harder but that's only because there are more steps to get the right answer. But the steps are very straightforward and if you memorize them you can kind of figure out the answer through pure logic(e.g. how a soda vending machine should work using a finite state machine).	5	6/19/2018
		"Almost entirely a repeat of cs061 in lecture
lab was boring and unrelated but not very difficult
one of the easiest classes ive ever taken"	1	8/24/2018
		Took it with Kelly Downey, Fall 2018. Material in the first half is the easy cs61 material(gates, adders, state machines, etc.) and the last half is RTL and hlsm which is kinda rough. She allowed us to use our notes during the midterm and final. Overall the homeworks weren't that difficult, just tedious sometimes. Labs can be rough in the beginning, but once you get used to the program you have to use, the labs should only give you trouble with writing the programs in verilog. That being said always ask for help when you don't know how to do something in verilog. My TA and lab mates were a great help and made the labs super short(30-45 mins) towards the end of the quarter. I also had to do a final project with a partner during the last 2 weeks, which wasn't that bad. You have 3 projects to chose from. 	4	2/21/2019
		Took with Downey. This class is easy, just take the time to learn Verilog in the beginning or else the labs and your mini-project are going to be extremely annoying. The lab manuals are outdated and rather unhelpful sometimes, but it may change. Your TAs are most likely not going to know Verilog - they're just there to grade. Midterm and final were open notes. 	5	3/20/2019
		Literally CS061 but with the actual hardware.	1	4/22/2019
		The labs are INFURIATING, but the class itself is pretty easy. The first half is CS61 review so the midterm was insanely easy. The second midterm you should really get RTL and FSMs down, but other than that it's not so bad!	5	3/20/2020
		I had a good partner for the labs, vague but grading is pretty chill, final project was stressful but as long as you put in effort and know what things do youll be fine	4	12/22/2020
		Took with Sheriff Sadiqbatcha in Winter 2020, the midterms and final were very similar to the practice exams, so make sure you understand those. Labs were in Verilog, not terribly difficult but TAs can help with explaining. Highly recommend attending TA office hours if you have questions regarding labs as the lab manuals are not very helpful. Overall the class was not very difficult but may be different in-person as I took it remotely.	4	3/15/2021
		With Sheriff, really easy class. The weighting of the course was more focused on homework and lab rather than exam, due to COVID. If you put in the time you will get a good grade	4	3/19/2021
		The class was very easy until week 8 (Chapter 5). RTL design gets people. But the first 3-4 weeks are a repeat of CS061. Sheriff is a great instructor, and overall, you won't have too much of a hard time in the class.	6	3/19/2021
		This class was very easy imo. Most of the quarter was just review from CS061. The labs all amount to copy-pasting some provided Verilog code and making minor changes. My lecture section was asynchronous. I would recommend not falling behind because while the content isn't the most difficult, it's painful to try to catch up. The homework assignments are pretty tedious and fairly long, but except for the last one, they aren't too difficult.	4	3/21/2021
		Only hard part about the class was the final mini project because Verilog is quite confusing. Take with Sheriff and you'll be good to go. Study practice midterms he gives you. HW can be very long so start early.	3	3/25/2021
		Sheriff was super flexible with everything. Midterms and finals were based off homework and he even provided practice exams! They pretty much gave the code for the labs in the manual, however the final project can be tough if you don't understand what the labs. You can do well by just watching the office hour lectures where he reviews the practice exams.	3	3/29/2021
		I do not recommend taking this class with Matt Vaezi, I believe it is his first year teaching at UCR as of writing this and I personally do not like his teaching style at all. He makes up his own slides which aren't great either and his homework assignments are the most confusing things ever. The labs are a huge pain as well since the TA (Amir Kavousi) requires an entire list of requirements in the lab reports and gets angry pretty easily. 	7	5/22/2021
		Our entire grade for this class came from 2 assignments, 1 midterm, 1 final, and all the labs/final project. Most of the content is a repeat of CS061, just more in-depth. If you did well in CS061 then 120A will be a breeze, if not then it might be a little challenging for you. 	3	6/16/2021
		Took this class in spring 2021 with Matt Vaezi as the professor and Amir Kavousi as the TA. This course was a horrible experience as neither of them put any preparation towards instructing the class and expected us to figure stuff out on our own with assignments and labs. Also couldnt even stick to their own syllabus as they said there would be 4 assignments throughout the quarter and the professor only assigned 2. Very little if any communication with emails and questions. Avoid instructor if possible	9	6/16/2021
		Basically a repeat of the CS061 concepts, but with easier labs (no LC3). Minimal homework. Exams are easy and basically the same as the homework.	1	11/12/2021
EE120B	7.04	Took with Phillip Brisk. Not as bad as 120A. The labs are done in C not Verilog which was a big relief for pretty much everyone lol. I'd recommend taking with Brisk to avoid getting Jeff'd, which at this point has become a meme. Tests and Midterms/Final were as expected, nothing that was not taught in class. Homework is done on zybooks. The custom lab project at the end of the year can be challenging, depending on how in depth you go. Labs aren't too bad. You can do it with a partner which makes things easier. You must pass (60%) the lab portion and the lecture section to pass the class. Must also pass the final exam and the custom lab project to pass as well. All said and done not too bad of a class. 	6	6/15/2018
		Really easy class, took it with Jeffrey McDaniel. All the difficulty lies in the custom project near the end of the quarter(week 7 or 8 I don't remember). The custom project took on average (anecdotally) 35-40 hours over a weekend to finish. The lecture is all Finite State Machines. Once you get comfortable with tinkering with the hardware(it will take you maybe a lab or two if you have no prior experience), it will be a simple class. The start is the hardest for this class but by mid-quarter you will probably also agree that it's relatively simple.	7	6/19/2018
		My favorite class ever... pick something you are actually interested in for your final project and try to just have fun with the class. If you are comfortable with FSMs and HLSMs then it should be a breeze	5	8/24/2018
		"I took this over the summer with Jeff. It was moderately difficult but that's mainly because of the pacing and I was usually too tired to study for the weekly quizzes/exams. Not sure if he's just more lenient over the summer or if Skate Club finally stopped the Jeffing. Most of the tests were basically drawing the state machines from the given problem descriptions, so you'll be fine for the quarter if you can easily do them and keep up with the material.

Labs were mostly simple and aren't too bad if you have a decent partner. But they can be time consuming if you don't know how to debug. I can't say how the final project is during the regular quarters, but summer projects are pretty easy. If you just spent your weekend working on it, you probably could have finished it already or at least be almost done unless you somehow just didn't understand the labs at all by that point."	7	8/31/2018
		Took this class with Philip Brisk. Every lecture was straight up him going over worksheets based off the ZyBooks courses, and then ten minutes of him lecturing you about life. After the midterm, all you work on are synchronous state machines, and ... that's about it. 50% lecture. 50% lab. The labs aren't that difficult; most of them should be easy points. The final lab project, however, is something that you need to work on by yourself. As long as your project has three complexities, you should be good to go. I think Brisk is a brilliant teacher, and so if you ever have the chance to take this class with him, you're in for a wonderful time.	5	3/25/2019
		I took this class with Philip Brisk. The first midterm was very easy but the second one is harder and the final is no cakewalk.	3	3/27/2019
		I took this class with Jeffrey McDaniels and he was a great professor. He even gave students the opportunity to gain experience in the embedded systems space off campus. The material isn't too hard, but the custom project can be if you're not starting early. I would suggest start the project early, order the parts early and go to office hours as much as possible.	7	6/17/2019
		Taking with Brisk. Probably because it’s online but this is not meant to be online. There’s more work than usual and he made the labs a bit different than previous years, no partner, and exams/quizzes are a bit different than previous years. Also if you don’t like his attitude then you’re not going to like the class. It’s a hit or miss, you like him or you don’t. Personally don’t like how sassy he can be and makes me afraid to ask questions because I think he’ll just make fun of me in front of the class. But anyway, so far it’s a bit hard if you don’t keep up with all the assigned work (zybooks, in class exercises, labs, etc). Be on top of the due dates and make sure you really understand concepts or you’ll be left behind. 	7	5/8/2020
		Took this during quarantine. This class was not difficult content wise, it was the amount of busy work that made it hard. Don’t be like me and procrastinate the labs because I had to spend entire weekends trying to meet the deadlines.	7	12/30/2020
		Lecture is easy if you understand the second half of 120A, labs are especially time consuming but not difficult	4	3/19/2021
		Took with Brisk. No examinations but hits you with 2 labs a week to compensate, and little help along the way. Honestly don't know where I would be if the people in discord weren't so helpful. Be prepared to drop $220 on lab parts. Don't procrastinate on the labs, try to finish one in the beginning of the week and one before the weekend for a good schedule set up.	7	3/25/2021
		I took this in Spring 2021 with Frank Vahid. This is easily one of my favorite CS classes. It can be difficult for CS/EE majors at first, but if you're a Computer Engineer, you'll feel right at home. I recommend taking this after CS100 to get used to Github. This class is VERY VERY VERY lab-focused. Labs were 45% of the total grade, and you have 1-2 each week. No final, but there weekly quizzes that aren't worth stressing over. Most of the labs take at least 3 hours minimum, and the average is 4ish hours. If you have a good professor (like Vahid), you'll love Embedded Systems.	5	6/9/2021
		Taking this with Philip Brisk in Fall 2021. This class has easily been the most frustrating and time consuming out of all the ones I've taken as a CS major. Two labs a week + Zybook readings + two midterms + final project + final exam + two quizzes makes this class a HUGE amount of work; it feels like two classes in one. And god help you if a hardware component stops working during one of your labs and you don't know why or you encounter a hardware problem that takes hours to solve. 	9	11/22/2021
		Took this class with Brisk. If you pay attention in class and understand the in class exercises the quizzes, midterms, and final are not difficult. That being said, the labs are brutal and Brisk did not offer much help. The difficulty of labs is not bad but they take so much work. After eleven labs the final project comes around to kick you when you are already down. Furthermore, Brisk does not respond to students, after the pandemic and difficult year everyone had you would think people gained an ounce or more of empathy for others - not Brisk. 	10	12/10/2021
		Avoid Brisk Avoid Brisk Avoid Brisk Avoid Brisk Avoid Brisk	9	12/10/2021
		Keep the momentum up in the class, it will help with your grade. Don't expect help from Brisk.	6	12/10/2021
		"Took it with Brisk. Take it with Vahid instead. Brisk isn’t bad, but he’s not good either. He doesn’t teach, all he does is provided a lot of in class exercises and solutions. Class content focuses on designing state-machines. The exams are very similar to the in-class exercises.
Lab is probably the hardest part about this class. 2 labs per week which take a good amount of time. Be prepared to work with hardware, write low-level C, spend hours debugging issues in your code or hardware. 3 week project is fun if you choose something you’ve passionate about."	7	12/10/2021
		There is no way to avoid the particular professor or TA as it is all about the instructor and how he/she presents the material (if at all). This class with Professor Brisk and his TA Mr. Meyer, was beyond difficult. Instructions, HW and labs, gradings, exams were absolutely awful. I feel very sorry as a student that had to go through such experience.	10	12/10/2021
		TAKE IT WITH VAHID, AVOID BRISK IF U CAN	7	12/11/2021
		Took this with Brisk. Would avoid if possible. The final project is what you need to focus on, it takes 3 weeks and is quite a lot of coding. TA's were unhelpful this quarter. There are 2 labs assigned per week, each designed to take 3 hours. However, they take longer than 3 hours usually per lab. Additionally, there is no dedicated lab session so you have to spend your own time on the labs. The exams are fair but wouldn't recommend taking with Brisk either way. Basically, the exams and in classes exercises and lectures aren't bad, but the final project with the 2 weekly labs are easily the worst part of the class. Adding that on with an unhelpful TA overall gives a bad experience. 	8	12/22/2021
		DO NOT TAKE IT WITH BRISK (winter 2022) !!! he is literally the most arrogant, unhelpful professor ever. he doesn't even teach, just made us do practice problems every lecture and would rush through the solutions at the end for useless participation points. the labs are so complicated and they changed it up this quarter so it is done in arduino instead of C, which is the language the lecture is taught in. the exams are extremely difficult and he does not prepare you for them at all. almost no helpful feedback is given on gradescope for exams and he has this stupid policy where if u fail the final you fail the class. the content isn't too hard but this was by far the worst class at ucr i've ever had to take. somehow i landed a b.	7	3/21/2022
EE123	8.00	Took with Roman Chomko Summer B 2020. Actually pretty hard. Chomko said the class was originally supposed to be for grad students and you can tell. In the undergrad version we only went over power calculation and types of power convertors, but even these were hard to get a full understanding of. The labs were easy though, just follow directions and done. Labs definitely help your understanding of the lecture so don't get lazy with them.	8	11/7/2021
EE128	3.00	Chomko the goat. Super easy exams that are open book open note, no HW, and labs weren't too bad either. For the project you just either gotta build something that includes two of the topics discussed in class, or something from the preapproved projects.	3	12/14/2021
EE132	5.00	Beware of the final. The class, while challenging, is manageable all the way up until finals week, where you're given a True or False final which is worth 40% of your grade. I went into the final with close to a B and left with a C+. It's one of the more interesting courses you will take as an Electrical Engineering major though. 	8	4/3/2017
		Took it spring2020, very easy, love the professor since he cares about this too. Don't worry about it. Prof Wen. Although the labs were a little tough.	2	12/18/2020
EE138	6.00	Took with Professor Haberer. Her slides have a lot of information, but overall the class was fair and she is very nice! Just make a study guide of the quizzes and homework and you'll do fine on exams. Take notes though definitely.	5	2/1/2021
		Had in 2022 with Haberer. She does examples. Very info heavy slides but she posts the slides. Quiz every week with one midterm and a final. She is a very generous grader but you have to study the concepts just as much as the formulas to get a good grade. 	7	12/19/2022
EE139	5.50	With Professor Mihri Ozkan, the course didn't have a midterm or a final. The quizzes were fair. There was a final presentation and paper, the instructions were not clear at all. Her slides are just screenshots of the book so learning wasn't very easy. 	6	2/1/2021
		only had two midterms and a final presentation. The class is mostly key terms and some definition not heavy math based. the first midterm was super easy if you study the midterm review second one was free response which was a little harder	5	12/2/2022
EE141	7.00	The material is pretty hard, the professor is good in class but lecture notes are trash, however he curves hard and makes avg a B+	7	12/15/2019
EE144	8.00	I took it in Fall of 2021. This class reminded me of EE 168 in that it starts off with hardcore mathematics and branches off into other topics towards the end. This class is cross-listed with ME 144 and so it has mostly ME and EE students but it feels more like an ME and CS class than any EE class. Its still worth taking for EE majors who want to work with robots since it doesn't have the ME prerequisite that EE 145 does.	6	12/9/2021
		Being a CEN major, this was by far the hardest class I've taken especially since grad students also take this class and there were a lot of ME concepts that I was not familiar with. The grading on the HW was also super strict. However, it was a very interesting class and made me even more excited about robotics. The labs were very easy since it was mostly coding, and the exams weren't too bad if you knew what you were doing.	10	12/14/2021
EE252	2.00	Fairly easy class, and the professor was very helpful 	2	1/3/2022
EE255	3.00	Took it with Kim. Fairly straight forward but interesting content, and very cool labs where you hack the Linux kernel and add/change the existing features. If you took CS153 or CS202, the content should look very familiar.	3	4/4/2023
ENGL001A	4.68	pretty basic english class. 4 essays on various topics.	5	3/28/2017
		Just write your essays and put at least some effort into them and you'll pass fairly easily.	2	6/28/2017
		It was difficult because I hate essays	7	7/1/2017
		Easy class. Do not slack off on your assignments because every point counts in this class. Definitely go to office hours if you need help on your essays as the professor is extremely helpful and will guide you on how to improve your essay.	5	12/18/2017
		The class is more laid back and open in comparison to the remedial classes before it. Class participation is important, get to know your professor and classmates to make class better. Quizzes are only partial and not too big. Essays are a big part of the class, don't forget to complete them. Turning in work late frequently, stagnates your grade. 	5	8/24/2018
		4 Essays, if you mess up you are done basically. We got the final ahead of time and wrote it in class. Really easy	5	11/6/2018
		It consists mainly of fitting 4 very important essays in 1 quarter. Lectures and classwork usually serve to teach or relate back to the current essay. Do your best on the essays, because each one is almost a quarter of your grade. The class is also a class where C- = fail, so don't even think you can skip doing 1 essay.	4	12/11/2018
		Dr. Spaise is very hard on grammar. Go to her office hours to review your essay and you’ll get A’s on your paper. 	7	12/15/2018
		Queen is a fun class to take. Types of essay, pretty interesting starter class	6	12/15/2018
		Not a lot of reading, but a decent amount of last-minute essay writing	3	12/16/2018
		Essays were graded pretty harshly for my professor... I got the same score for all my essays give or take 1-2% so...	7	12/18/2018
		Essays make up nearly 80% of you overall grade. The final was an easy A. Took the class with Allie Arend and she provided make-ups for every single essay!	5	2/19/2019
		Had Dr. Smedley. She is very nice and friendly and encourages you to attend office hours. I find it helpful to go to her office hours. Gives helpful constructive criticisms.	7	3/7/2019
		Kim Turner. GO to office hours. And if she likes you, then you will do well. if she doesnt then try to make her like you	8	3/23/2019
		I had Dr. Spaise. Definitely go to office hours if you struggle, it was a basic English class though. Not much in class writing, but a strong focus on grammar and she assigns a few worksheets. 	5	4/3/2019
		Brittany Roberts is a great instructor. Super helpful and well-spoken. Her class is easy-going and the homework is easy too. Most of the time, the homework is to read and prepare for essays. There are a total of 4 papers, with different word counts and they are worth different amounts. Her grading is far and she provides a lot of helpful feedback. 	4	11/21/2019
		for innes, super easy. easy grader, rambles on and on in class	2	11/21/2019
		Go to office hours, its ridiculous how much easier the class will be. Had a TA rather than a prof, pretty easy A. Not a lot of busywork which was nice. Straight up: 4 essays & an in class essay final.	2	12/10/2019
		Get Sarah Buckner!! She’s such a sweetheart and she’s not a super hard grader. Understands that students have it hard so is a little easier compared to other Eng profs	2	12/10/2019
		I never really understood what English TAs look for when grading essays. The class is pretty boring and essay prompts are sort of vague and hard to write about. The class will destroy your grade if you suck at writing essays as 90% of your grade is based on those. Hope that you get an easy TA/professor to teach your class.	7	12/12/2019
		I had professor Vasquez and she was awesome. I usually hate going to English, but I actually enjoyed having her. The class has a heavy weight on essays so make sure you go to office hours and get help. Otherwise, it’s not that bad of a class	5	12/13/2019
		Had Prof. Gurnett, She really cares about helping you improve your grade. 3 essays, 1 midterm, 1 final, read 3 books. There is a specific format in which you are to write your essays, even if your essay is good it will get an F if not in that format. Pretty hard grader and participation is extremely important. Near the end of the quarter you will be allowed to revise one of your essays.	6	12/16/2019
		Jaquelyn Vasquez is an amazing teacher! She replies very fast to emails and is always super helpful during office hours! Just be sure not to procrastinate on your essays :)	3	12/18/2019
		Four essays and one final :)	4	12/20/2019
		Pretty standard English class, reading isn't necessarily too important as long as you get the main points and sound like you know what you're talking about. 	1	1/3/2020
		VanZandt is the best prof ever she is so nice and understanding and doesn't put a lot of pressure on students. 4 essays, one final based on the book she has you read. Even though she is nice she grades essays fairly hard so make sure you have good essays, those will bring you down if you aren't careful. She let us revise our lowest essay which helped me a lot so if she offers that to you don't pass on the opportunity. 	4	2/7/2020
		jones is laidback but he puts effort into teaching what exactly should be in your essay, and he is lenient on grading essays	6	3/20/2020
		I took the class with Grant Palmer, he was a super nice and chill guy. Would definitely recommend you to take his class. 	4	7/25/2020
		Took the class with Nolan Goetzinger, super helpful professor. Went to all of his office hours to have my essays looked over and his feedback is basically free points added to your essay. I believe there were four essays plus the final, so the class is pretty fast paced, about 2 weeks per essay. Don't buy the St Martins Guide since you can easily find free versions online. 	4	7/28/2020
		"Took it with Cline Fall 2020. Super nice and caring professor who helped a lot if you went to office hours (she will tell you straight up how to improve your essays). The assignments were easy and interesting. Occasionally there will be a ""pop quiz"" but sometimes she hints at it the class before, so show up to every class. Majority of your grade is essays, but they are not hard. You read a novel towards the end of the quarter which wasn't difficult either (just keep on top of the readings). Final is comprehensive of things you learned in SMG and also from the novel. Cline grades easy and is super chill. Take the class with her if you can."	4	9/5/2020
		TRY TO GET Alexander Allaport! He’s a really fun teacher and he’s very helpful and considerate when it comes to grading! 	5	11/3/2020
		Amanda Oliver is understanding, class is easy, participation is not required, gives u extension if you ask for it, attendance not required 	2	11/24/2020
		I had Terry Spaise and she’s a relatively easy professor. She’ll give you extensions if you need it. Other than that, grading is mostly based on 3 essays and the final.	3	11/25/2020
		Took the class during Fall 2020(online b/c of covid) with grad student Miranda Steege, if you can try to get her! She structured the class very well and gave really helpful feedback on essays. Her paper prompts were also very well organized and listed every point you needed to hit to at least get a B. 4 essays, so if you screw up on one it'll be hard to come back from it, however if you go to her office hours she will be really helpful in telling you everything you need to fix and improve on to get a good grade. Final was a pretty short and easy take-home reflection essay.	4	12/13/2020
		I had this class with Stamp and he gives really good feedback. We had 4 essays and a final essay (2-3 pages) that were 15%, 20%, 20%, 25%, and 15% of our grade. Ask questions about your own essay or just questions in general during class and office hours. Very helpful when providing feedback and suggestions+advice. Doesn't really say much in the comments on your essay but if you ask for feedback during office hours he will most definitely help you. I had a 65% on my second essay but ended the class with an 84.7% (B).	5	12/18/2020
		I had Dr. Terry Spaise, she is very kind and helpful, although a bit old fashioned? She focuses a lot on grammar, paragraph spacing, and commas. We had to write 4 essays, the final being a position essay. The different between an A and an A- is the grammar and paragraph spacing, so pay attention to that. She is always willing to help and answer questions, and she let us submit rough drafts, which were very helpful. Just write the essays carefully and pay attention to the details. She cares about grammar. Those who complain about this probably did not try hard enough, it is not that complicated. She's a great professor	4	12/20/2020
		"Taken with Lee Singh in Fall 2020. Four  essays each worth 18% of grade, and ""letters"" worth 1% each is all the homework you get. She grades strictly according to the textbook u need to purchase, ""The St. Martins Guide to Reading and Writing"", so make sure to look at the essay examples and identify how you can model your essay off them. I had an extremely hard time doing well on the essays in the beginning and my lowest essay score was an 80%, so she grades PRETTY HARSHLY. However, this does not mean you cannot pass. Her final though, YOU NEED TO HAVE TIME MANAGEMENT FOR...she gives you the fourth essay and the final  three weeks before they are due two days in a row. The finals consists of a 1500 word essay and two 500 word essays which have to do with the in class reading ""The Glass Castle"". Let me tell you...read the book the whole way through, or you WILL NOT pass this final. Basically, she assigns the fourth essay and 3 finals essays to complete in less than three weeks with no exceptions. ALSO...USE HER OFFICE HOURS...you get to read your drafts to her and she will give grammatical and content suggestions to improve your essays and also gives suggestions as to how you can use remaining days to refocus or bulk up what you are writing."	5	1/4/2021
		Paul AJ Beehler; would not recommend him. CON: Does 2-3 reading each week, assigned 3 different types of homework, grades fairly harsh on essays, have pop quizzes everyday when you come into class. PRO: very interactive in the beginning of class and all throughout, always offers office hours.	8	2/3/2021
		I took English001A with Kathleen Gurnett and it was absolutely terrible. The whole class is just reading a bunch of essays and writing essays. In class, all you ever do is reread what she told us before and teaches nothing. She is an extremely hard grader and super picky. If you have to take the class, I would suggest not taking it with her (if that is a option)	9	3/6/2021
		A TA will be teaching this class, I had 3 essays with an additional draft for essay 3 and a fine. I procrastinated lot and still ended up getting an A so it depends how the TA will grade.	7	3/18/2021
		"I took this class with Professor Washburn. Her lectures aren't too bad and the workload is fair. We pretty much only wrote three essays, read ""In Between the World and Me"", and took the final, which was a timed essay. Honestly, I'd recommend taking English with her. She's really nice and understanding."	4	6/2/2021
		I took this class with Professor Gurnett during Spring 2021. She’s a tough grader and a huge part of the class is participation. I had read on Ratemyprofessor that she often accused students of plagiarism but decided to take the class anyway. I can definitely say that this is a problem but you can meet with her during office hours to discuss it. 	7	6/4/2021
		Took it online(Spring'21) -Prof Anne Schnarr - small and easy quizzes, 3 essays (+1 final essay) easiest final , go to office hours for each essay(she will write the essay with you). Good luck!	3	6/14/2021
		Can be hard if your first language is not english. It also depend heavily on your professor or the graduate student hat is teaching you. But overall the content is there and train you to write more effectively. Just go to your office hour and visit ARC for writing support.	5	12/13/2021
		I had Professor Vasquez, she is very kind. She has a class critique structure such that you could see how other people reflect on different essays from your classmates.	5	12/15/2021
		Make sure to start essays earlier on! Apply strategies professors mention in your essays.	4	12/25/2021
		Pretty easy class tbh. I had Akshay Ganesh. We only had one book to read and he went through it during many classes so it was pretty easy. Essay prompts are okay as well, only difficulty is time management imo.	3	12/25/2021
		Had Professor Inyang for online class. It was easy and just required some readings. She was really nice and accommodating for everyone. She didn't give us quizzes because we didn't have time, so be careful for any future classes. Make sure you participate in the class.	3	2/4/2022
		Easy class 4 essays.	1	3/7/2022
		I took it with colin innes, he's a very easy professor. We had 4 essays, two books to read.  2/4 essays + the final were about the books.	3	3/17/2022
		Albert Anthony grades very hard and has it out for his students. If he does not like your opinion he will fall you even though you put in the time and effort.	2	3/30/2022
		I had Dr. Acker, honestly super nice and helpful. There is no hw, only 3 essays and some classwork. Workload is easily manageable as long as you don't procrastinate on essays. His essay outlines are really helpful and tell you exactly what he is looking for. His corny jokes and stories are somewhat enjoyable. Overall 10/10 professor.	3	12/5/2022
		I had Karen Polster. I hate writing so I biased to more difficultly. Required 4 essays and a group final film presentation. Max score on essay is 95%. Lowest is 80%. Easy to pass almost impossible to get an A since her standard for A is 95%. A- 90-95%	7	12/7/2022
		Really depends on who your professor or TA is! Make sure to take advantage of office hours to get feedback on essays, since they will be the main part of your grade.	5	12/22/2022
		All depends on the teacher. My teacher made it extremely essay, reading wasn't required but I recommend skimming but don't read the full book because it's a waste of time. I got a B+ with out trying and my final was a presentation on a movie that I didn't watch and did it within 30 minutes before class and got an A.	6	6/9/2023
ENGL001B	4.83	harder than 1A mainly because my professor required participation... I didn't participate at all really but ended up with a B	7	3/28/2017
		writing is important 	7	3/31/2017
		Challenging especially if you're not a skilled writer. 	7	4/3/2017
		The professor John Stamp is a fair grader and redditor, so I really liked his class.	6	7/1/2017
		Take Colin Innes. Super easy and chill class.	3	10/1/2017
		I Had Professor Knight. 4 Essays, No Midterms, and 1 Final. Essays were easy to get a B/B- but EXTREMELY hard to get an A-/A. No homework aside from reading which isn't mandatory. You have to be a stellar writer if you want any kind of A in this class. Nice professor overall though - very understanding.	7	12/5/2018
		Emphasizing on different types of argumentative essay work rather than novel reading and analysis	7	12/15/2018
		Try to take with Professor Polster, she is a great professor and is very helpful with the feedback provided. At the same time, she makes the class very independent and makes the class a good experience. In my quarter, she made the class finish in 9 weeks. Just expect to do some casual reading and do the essays ahead of time, it helps to grow as a writer.	4	12/15/2018
		I had Stina Attebery as a professor and would recommend. She is a fair grader, and as long as you address the prom,pt and other necessarily things for your essay, you can get a good grade for your essay. I found the class very interesting because she had us read and go over science fiction. But if you hate science fiction, your experience might vary. 	5	12/21/2018
		Decent class. Easier than 1A. Focus on argumentative aspects. 	5	2/6/2019
		Easy class. Just a lot of reading. We had to read The Fifth Season and write our final essay on that. Make sure to participate in class and go to office hours to get help on your essays. If you have the St. Martin's Guide, use it. The sentence frames and sample essays in there are super useful. 	3	3/21/2019
		Bradfield is great. Just essays and research nothing big. 	5	3/23/2019
		If you can, take this class with Simon Lee. Passionate professor and only 3 essays plus no final. There was a little bit of reading you had to do before each class, but nothing too bad. The workload in this class was significantly lower than my friends’ english 1b’s class.	4	3/24/2019
		The class material isn’t extremely difficult, but requires work. If you have the option, do NOT take this class with Aran Park. It’s very obvious English is not her first language, which is fine, but not for an English class. She has difficultly speaking grammatically correct English in class. She assigns a ridiculous amount of reading and homework. In one week you can expect 60 pages of reading, an annotated bibliography and outline, a rough draft, online discussions, in class essays and pop quizzes. Miss class 5 times and you fail. It was chaos. I advise to look at the rate my professor scores beforehand if at all possible. 	6	5/30/2019
		Absolutely take with Dr. Polster. She sets clear guidelines on how to get a B, but do a little more than what she asks and you can get a higher grade. Very fair grader, and we discussed the final exam in the class before. 	3	6/15/2019
		TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR TAYLOR EVANS!! He is a super caring and amazing professor who will always help with your writing if you need it. I got a B- on the first essay and went to office hours to gradually get an A on the last essay and final essay. I am not good at English but Evans really made me enjoy it and i highly recommend him to everyone (he has a 5.0 rating on ratemyprofessor!)	4	10/25/2019
		Took this class with Prof Polster and was very nice and tells you what she wants for a B, so if you want an A you just have to write a page more then she recommends and a few more pieces of evidence. Straightforward with what she wants. There are three papers, and the final is on the book read throughout the quarter. As well as 3 quizzes on the same book to make sure your keeping up with the reading. Enjoyed her class!	3	11/29/2019
		My professor (Karen) was pretty chill. Not sure about the others though	4	12/10/2019
		tons of reading to do for this class, which you can lose track of if you're not careful. if you take this class, take it with Innes, his essays have little structure to follow and are pretty easy to get at least a B on. final consisted of two essays about the readings in the class. had the occasional pop quiz, but wasn't really hard. he doesn't update grades on iLearn though, so be warned. 	5	12/14/2019
		Two physical books were required for the class (St martins guide and the ethics of what we eat) . In total there was 3 essays that we’re not done in class worth 15%, 20%, and 20%. The homework was reading logs (around 250 words each) worth 5 points each. There was 2 presentations that we had to do (one in a group and one solo) worth 25 points each. The midterm was an evaluation of the ethics of what we eat. We were allowed to bring in notes and an outline. The final was a close reading of a short story that we’ve never read. Not a difficult class at all. 	2	12/17/2019
		Essays were graded super harshly.	9	12/17/2019
		took it with Innes. bruh it was a joke 	2	12/21/2019
		Robert Jones: Interesting lectures, does not have a set grading rubric for essays	7	12/24/2019
		Take Taylor Evans!! He is super nice and genuinely wants to help students succeed. I got a B on my first essay, and I did revisions on it and got an A-. I went to his office hours and my grades on the essays improved. He ended up bumping me up to an A- from a B+ because he thought it was fairer due to my progress in the class. As long as you show him that you are willing to learn and improve your skills, as well as pay attention in class and complete your readings, you will get a good grade. 	5	12/27/2019
		I had professor Benedict Jones. He's very very meticulous with how he wants his assignments done and it was fairly overwhelming for a majority of the class for at least the first half of the quarter. He has a strange personality, but you can tell he's extremely passionate about his students and his career, often staying hours after his office hours to individually help his students. Three take home essays (with a crazy amount of prep time for each), one in-class essay, essay final, a few homework assignments that are basically just research and prep for your essays, and some group quizzes. You are allowed to skip the final IF you are doing well in the class (I think A's in essay 1+2) and you get at least an A- for the in-class essay. He sometimes gives opportunities to redo an essay (for a slight penalty) if you did particularly poorly or missed some key criteria required for said essay. The essays are graded pretty harshly and he is a stickler on sentence structure and grammar, but going to office hours and asking for his advice on your essay is the best way to get a good grade. Not a lot of reading other than some pages from the textbook occasionally and one pretty good book. He does make you watch some movies in the last half of the quarter, but you can do that on your own time and it's one movie a week basically. Most of his class revolves around teaching students the basics of writing and how to use the library/other sources properly. Throughout the quarter, he guides you through the process of how to write/prep the essays, especially the first essay, and he doesn't just expect a multiple page essay out of nowhere. The weeks leading up to an essay due date will be almost exclusively used for teaching you how to approach a certain type of essay or how to use a database to get research information for your essay and etc. Almost every lecture is tailored into helping your assignments out in some way. Having complex sentences and flow in your essays will get you a high grade. His class is certainly not an easy A, or even an easy B, but an A is absolutely achievable. If you want to actually take to heart what is being taught and genuinely want to become more proficient in English, take his class.	8	1/5/2020
		Avoid Benedict Jones AT ALL COSTS. He is the WORST professor at UCR period. Tons of useless busy work and will cause you to fall behind in your other classes. IMPOSSIBLE to get an A I bet he couldn't even do all the work he assigns himself. 	10	2/21/2020
		"Took it with Professor Robert Jones. I passed with a B, so he wasn't difficult with grading. It's more about how he words his prompts and him understanding your topic to the prompts. Very confusing, so it's recommended to go to his office hours. Attendance was not mandatory, and honestly was not necessary since whatever he talked about during class was not relevant or helpful to your essays. The only days you need to attend are the days he set for your oral presentations and the days right before the essay is due, this is when he asks for your topic ideas and he'll talk about some. He assigned readings before each lecture from two books, 1984 (Orwell) and Brave New World (Aldous Huxley), but I passed without needing to read the whole book. The final was dumb but easy, it had questions about different types of fallacies (not MC), and his ""essay"" questions were unrelated to what we've talked about all quarter."	3	2/27/2020
		WITH SMEDLEY!! She gives TOO much work. It’s ridiculous. It came to the point where she had to cancel her own quizzes or hw because she didn’t even have time to do all of it. Avoid at all costs	10	2/28/2020
		If you have to take an English class, make sure you take it with a grad student because they give the best feedback on your writing. I had Summer Sutton and she was great - she was readily available outside of class, whether through office hours, after class, or by email, for feedback, which was very helpful in my writing. We read N.K. Jemisin's The Fifth Season and wrote 4 essays for the quarter, all argumentative, and the essay and grading criteria were easy to understand. No complaints here.	2	3/2/2020
		There's about seven English professors for this class, and Colin Innes is undoubtedly the easiest one. Ignore whatever the previous reviews say, Colin Innes will make your experience SO much better. His assignments were extremely easy and, despite having like three essays to do, he gave a selection of prompts to choose from so we weren't limited to one option and could write on what we were most passionate about. He's also very forgiving, I asked for an extension on one of my papers and he gave me a full additional week to finish it. BEST professor you will get in the English department if you're a lazy student.	1	3/4/2020
		Took with Theresa Lee. 4 essays, 3 done at home and one in class on the reading. Only one book assigned. Most of the class is basically just group work through worksheets and debates. There's 2 debates throughout the quarter and they happen pretty close to when the essays are due so can't slack off as much. No midterm, one final (essay). She also doesn't grade super hard from what I've experienced. Seems pretty easy to get around the B+ to A range on her essays. 	2	3/9/2020
		About the same difficulty in terms of writing essays as 1A. Lots of essays (5 in total including the final) throughout the quarter. Ended with an A, but that's only because my TA graded easy. In all honesty, English is a class that depends on how your English TA or professor grades. Hopefully you get lucky and get a good TA/professor. I recommend Chelsea Keane, she's very nice and grades easy.	4	3/21/2020
		Essays are graded hard 	7	3/26/2020
		I took it with Albert Anthony. He is a great guy but hard to understand for people who don't have a dry sense of humor. He has pop reading quizzes so you need to make sure you do the reading at all times. He has weekly projects which are tedious in the moment but it's a great grade booster. He only had 3 essays so you have to put effort into them if you want an A in the class. 	6	3/27/2020
		Took this class with Dr. Hunt. I recommend going to his office hours to look over your draft(s) because he is really helpful and gives good advice on how to improve your paper. There are pop quizzes, but you will realize the pattern of when he has them. For the discussion posts, understand the argument of the chapter and how it connects to the overall argument. No midterm, 4 papers, 1 final, which wasn't too bad. Rarely gives out A's, but his grading is fair. 	6	3/29/2020
		Took it with Dr. Stephanie Fousek. Her class is boring sometimes, but she's a nice and caring professor. Go to her office hours since she'll help you do better on your essays. Do your readings and put in the effort. If you do all of the above, then it's possible to get an A.	6	4/22/2020
		first things first, if you get prof Siglos know you're lucky asl. I love him :,). he's so lenient and makes the essay topics interesting and easy to write. he grades fairly too. I had this class during the pandemic. he was very understanding about the difficult transition to online classes. 3 essays and he cancelled our final. easy	3	6/12/2020
		Harder than 1B because you're required to use resources from the UCR database and know how to integrate resources into your writing and expect to explain them with detail. Had professor Jeshua Enriquez and he was a really cool professor. We read Fight Club, which is a dope ass book, and he was not too too picky on grading so this class was a good experience. His final exam was just a way to tie all essays and the book together and nothing to stress about so if you're looking for a quality english professor who assigns cool books to read, this is your professor.	6	6/16/2020
		Took it with Kali Simmons Winter 2020. Super relatable and chill professor, but a little tough when it comes to grading. Majority of grades is essays as usual, but there are some in class assignments that go toward your total essay grade so show up to every class. I'm pretty sure she also took attendance and graded for participation too. She is helpful in office hours only if you know exactly what you need help on. Her assignments are not tedious and there wasn't much homework. For some perspective I think most students got C's/B's and A-'s on the essays. She grades heavily on essay organization and argument strength, less on writing style/content. Overall Simmons is super chill to talk with.	6	9/5/2020
		Took this online and Professor Polster was extremely fair and made essay writing easy by providing clear guidelines!	2	9/10/2020
		Definitely one of the easiest classes I took in my first quarter in college (took with Prof. Kenyon). He's a great professor and gives good feedback on your writing. I'm personally a strong writer so I had no issue; homework and essay topics are all fairly straightforward. If you've taken AP Lit, I'd say this class shouldn't be a struggle whatsoever. 	2	12/1/2020
		I had this class with Professor Aram Adijian. He's a super cool and chill professor! Our only assignments were 4 Essays, which were usually 4-5pg, and our final, two 500 word essays. He really explained everything and is passionate about what he teaches. Had a great time! I received an 88% and could have reached for an A but I got lazy and decided to not do the make up essay he allows students to do in order to get a better grade on one previous essay. 	5	12/22/2020
		Had Professor Queen. Class was focused on the paranormal and ghosts whixh was really fun. There are 3 essays and a final.	5	12/28/2020
		I had professor schroeder and I really enjoyed her class! There was 4 major essays that we had to do, but the topics were relatively easy and she wasn't a super harsh grader! We didn't have time to do our quizzes for that class, so in the end we only took about 1/3 that were planned. The final was also pretty easy, with the entire essay being about the book that she assigned plus the movie we had to watch. I only watched the movie, but I was able to get an A on the final!! Overall the class was fairly easy.	3	1/11/2021
		Took it with Kristen Skjonsby. Not a particularly hard class, just be sure to do the work and you'll be fine. Essay-wise, go to office hours (more than the mandatory ones) and ask about the essay. She helps you a lot and it'll guarantee you a better grade. Her essay prompts aren't super straightforward, so be sure to double check your thesis/overarching work before writing the whole essay. Super caring professor and very flexible with students.	3	3/15/2021
		"Honestly, you're ENGL001B class experience, and your English class experience in general depends on the professor you get. With that said, avoid Rory Moore. She assigns so much work, and doesn't announce quizzes because ""they're on the syllabus"" (17 pages might I add). She reports people to academic misconduct for plagiarism without even informing them. Literally half the people in her class (including myself) dropped because of the heavy workload. Essay prompts were confusing and boring. She claims the workload is the same for all ENGL001B classes, but when I retook the class with Lorelei Baughman, we had exponentially AND significantly way less work compared to Rory Moore. Speaking of Lorelei Baughman, she's an absolute sweetheart, and an amazing professor. At one point she was wondering why we hardly asked questions, and our class had to explain to her that she does an absolute fine job at explaining. Encourages us to reach out to her. if you ever see her class open TAKE IT. Our class focused on food, and she always assigned these fun readings. Our final was easy, essay prompts were easy. She teared up when we told her at the end of the quarter how much we would miss her class. "	5	3/31/2021
		Take this with Colin Innes	6	4/1/2021
		(Online Class)THIS CLASS MADE ME LOVE ENGLISH CLASSES AGAIN!!!! Had Kurt Paczkowski. 3 take home essays and 1 essay final (timed online). You're allowed to revise 1 of the take home essays and that score will average with your original essay score. Attendance is required but he is super lenient and understanding. His grading is really easy compared to most English professors and he provides time extensions like candy. He also connects with the students and converses with them during each meeting (writers workshop) and shows up with the biggest smile and all those positive vibes even if he's not having a great day. 	1	5/17/2021
		I took ENGL1B with Professor Furtado. It was okay. Most classes were spent doing group activities on the book we were reading (The Fifth Season) and then presenting our work. As long as your group pulls their weight, the class is okay. There are also three essays, a final, and quizzes. The essays were okay. She doesn't grade super hard but it does take a while for her to get the grades back to you. It took about a month to receive the grade for the first essay.. The quizzes are okay. Most of them were take home so we had a day or two to work on it. She did have one pop quiz though. It was a little hard, but it wasn't worth too much. Overall, I would recommend taking ENGL1B with Professor Furtado. Sometimes it was a little frustrating because she'd take so long to grade (and the class is more work than ENGL1A), but she's a really nice professor and I felt that I learned a thing or two.	5	6/2/2021
		This class basically changed my pov on English. It really depends on who you get as your TA. I surprisingly loved it because of TA I had. She was super helpful and made going to class fun and interesting. 3 essays and 1 final like the previous Engl001 classes. 	6	6/30/2021
		Ben Harder is an amazing lecturer but very harsh grader. Just by going off of canvas, the highest possible score anyone has is a 93.87. Expect to finish with an A- max.	5	12/7/2021
		Had Robyn Johnson as my ENGL001B instructor. Wasn’t super hard of a class if you did AP English Lang in high school. Go to her office hours if you struggle with writing, and do it in advanced so you’re not scrambling to finish your essay. 4 essays, 1 student presentation + analysis, and a final in the class overall. Participation and peer review is a big part of the class, so you’ll be expected to talk to your peers during class about your essays, readings, etc. Johnson is very fair in terms of grading and is flexible with extensions so long as you let her know before the deadlines. You’ll be guaranteed a one week extension to use for one of your first 3 essays but other than that, there isn’t any extra credit she can give. There may be some opportunities to receive more extensions, but it’ll depend on Johnson’s feelings about it. There aren’t a lot of assignments in the class so try not to miss any assignments or your grade will drop by a lot.	6	12/19/2021
		Winter 2022 half online and half in-person. AVOID GEROGE CUNNINGHAM at all cost. No cap this man is real mad and racist. His lectures are super confusing and he never gives specific grading scales for all the essays. Because he never has a real-specific-prompt, everything is in his head and he basically decides what to give it to you. Super annoying man and literally make things up in his mind. Btw, he is a new professor at UCI (originally from UCI), so maybe he will become more generous later on. But still, better to stick with another senior UCR professor. 	8	3/17/2022
		Took with Aran Park Winter 2022 Quarter. She has negative reviews, but I wouldn't say she's that bad--considering I didn't mind putting in a lot of work to her assignments. She does a few pop quizzes, but they're worth very little of your overall grade. She can be picky about grading, but GO TO OFFICE HOURS. There you can ask her for advice and she can tell you what she thinks needs to be revised. When she sees you take her suggestions and actively advocate to improve your standing in this class, you will get a good grade. Class attendance is essential; she takes attendance and missing one class can result in you falling behind. There were 5 essays in total. Midterm and final timed write online, and 3 written essays. Going to the ARC tutoring center for writing support helped me improve my essays as well. Office hours + writing support + class attendance you're guaranteed a solid B. 	4	3/18/2022
		Really depends on your instructor	6	3/27/2022
		I had it with Claire O' Brian in Winter 2022. She's an awesome teacher who is spirited and funny. However, the workload is little iffy. Granted, its not really her choice but rather the course that requires 4 essays for the entire course. Once the class picks up, it just keeps going. We had peer review letters to write in response to people's rough drafts. It was helpful for those who needed advice but also stressful because we had to do our essays a lot sooner (for someone who procrastinates like me ToT). Also the letters to me were added work/stress but at the same time is just a 1 pager so its not too bad. Just make sure to keep up with the class. 	5	9/30/2022
		I took this class with Joanna Bradfield and she is one of the bets professors I have had. Super understanding and provides a lot of opportunity to get your work in and get extra points. Make sure to turn in all the little assignments cause they really help boost your grade. She is easy to reach out to and talk to so don't hesitate, do show up to class though. 	4	12/27/2022
		Had Prof. K. Persinger. Honestly, you don't really have to pay attention in class unless they talk about the essays. Pace yourself because those essays get long (ex. 7-8 pages) and go to office hours! They are more than willing to step-by-step guide you on your essay. There isn't a lot of busy work besides the essays because pretty much all your assignments are done in class or are very short annotations which you can easily complete. If you are familiar with essay writing and how to make essays long, this class is pretty easy for you.	5	3/22/2023
		I took it with Carrie Jean. Pretty standard english class with 3 essays which are the bulk of your grade. Carrie is very kind and understanding, gives great feedback on papers, and very helpful office hours. There was also a pretty long book to read that tied into the themes of the class and connected to the final. Make sure to give yourself enough time to work on your essays, and the class should be fun!	6	4/2/2023
		I had it with Professor Rust, it was really easy, but with it being online and all. Got a B+ in the class so it wasn't bad. Only thing was annoying is that the Essays prompts werr confusing. Just go to Office Hours and you will be fine.	1	4/3/2023
		I had Cassandra Van Zandt in Winter 2023 and she a very nice and understanding teacher, she would push back due dates if she saw that as a group we needed it, she gave in class work as cushioning for our overall grade and we only had 3 essays and a final which was a choice between a final paper and a creative project. Choose the creative project, its easy and you’ll probably get the same grade or better as a final paper. She lets you resubmit one of the first 2 essays at the end of the quarter after fixing it. I will say she is a bit of a tough grader when it comes to essays (which is why I chose the creative project) but if you go to her office hours with a draft and fix what she says, you can get a high B or an A. We also read a book that she provided a free version of, but most of the other readings were not long and from the text book. As long as you try you should pass, I probably would have gotten an A- but thanks to the creative project I got an A+.	3	4/23/2023
		spring2023 took with prof george cunningham, not hard but a LOT of busy work. just be ready to do some assignment every other day that honestly doesn't matter. 3 major papers - mostly research, and 1 final exam (on a book). goes on a tangent sometimes and isn't very organized though	4	6/5/2023
		Easy A if u just do ur work on time.	3	6/9/2023
ENGL001C	5.63	Hackelton was a good professor but a hard grader.  Easy to get a B, hard to get an A.  Lots of in-class essays and the final was take home.  Would give pop quizzes so show up to class!	7	4/2/2018
		I took this class with Alexander Sterling. He is my favorite professor I've ever had, so I would recommend trying to get him. He will definitely make you do work/set up ways to make sure you're staying on track so there's almost always some kind of assignment due. Even though it was kind of annoying to have a lot of work sometimes it really helped my writing improve in the end. Just make sure you do what he says. 	7	6/9/2018
		AVOID THERESA LEE! SHE IS THE DEVIL!! I put soooo much time and effort into her class but for some reason she had some sort of a personal vendetta against me. She gave me an 89.99 on every single essay I turned in to avoid giving me an A	10	12/15/2018
		Collin Innes! easy and nice has some in class essays, but easy topics. Graded off essays and sometimes quizzes or one page analysis. 	2	3/7/2019
		If you can, take Sarah Buckner, she's amazing. She's not too harsh of a grader for essays and a good chunk of points comes from participation and discussion. Quite a few readings, but you can get away with reading sparknotes, as long as you contribute once or twice per discussion and say something intellectual. 	5	3/23/2019
		I took the class with Anderson and he was quite funny and easy going. Most of your grade is based off your essay scores. He is a bit of a hard grader so it may be hard to get an A on his essays. 	8	4/8/2019
		I think english classes really depend on the professor. I had Watt and she was alright. Easy class to get a B in, but its pretty hard to get an A. 	5	12/14/2019
		Had the class with instructor Quarterman, really fun and easy class if you’re a strong writer. The essays were enjoyable to write in my opinion. Not a hard grader but not an easy one either. Very discussion based class, not a lot of lecture so it was a pretty chill class. Only read two books and studied pop culture material (music videos, movies, tv shows). Our class was centered around madness so it was just a really interesting class overall.	3	12/17/2019
		I have Chelsea Keane, super nice and chill. Idk if its due to the pandemic, but we only had two essays, and majority of the class grade is on discussions/participations, as long as u do your work you’ll def pass the class. 	3	5/8/2020
		Had it with Brandy Lewis. She is really nice and I could tell she cares about her students. Class was a bitch though she focused it around taxidermy, and animal semiotics. It was really hard to absorb and write about I dropped around week 4.	7	6/12/2020
		This class was a bit difficult for me since it was all argumentative. I had Wallace Cleaves as my prof but I had a TA (Soraya Zarook) teach all the materials. Soraya was really nice and open to giving ideas and helping students come up with topics as well as strengthening their positions. There's two required books but you can find one of them online as a pdf. Soraya wasn't that tough of a grader, just make sure to have solid evidence to back up your claims. She also gives out really helpful feedback. 	6	3/20/2021
		took online with professor anderson, he was pretty chill but grades essays pretty hard. easy to get a B, hard to get an A.	7	3/29/2021
		I took this class Summer 2021, Instructor Enriquez was firmly one of the best instructors I've ever attended. His enthusiasm for the class was one that is very rare, and his slides and explanations throughout the course were the best. Definitely had a strong impression on what is like to be an English professor. He explained many things again and again, until he was sure that ALL students understood the material. He was clear about what he expects in his essays, and his grading were very generous in my opinion. He pushed back essay deadlines to account for his student's comforts, and he was so nice with his comments and grading. I went to him 4 times for one thesis of a particular essay, and he perfected it with me for as long as I went! 	2	8/26/2021
		"I had a TA named Nolan Goetzinger and he was super nice and a fair grader. I haven't received an A in English since freshman year of high school, but I was able to get a 97 in this class. Only drawback is his focus is on nature poetry but at least it's modern poetry and you don't have to write poems. I took it over this past summer (2021) and he gave us 3 essays, journal entries graded on completion, and a ""final"" journal where you write about your experience in the class."	2	9/9/2021
		TAKE CLASS with Chelsea Price. She's an amazing teacher and very understanding. Only have to do 3 essays. Topics were very easy: 1 Aladdin 2 Fate Zero Anime 3 Marvel Thor! Easiest class and she gives the option of not doing an essay. (taken spring 2021)	1	10/29/2021
		Prof. Sang Keun Yoo was really nice and his class was easy. 3 essays, 1 final paper (talking about your experiences in the class and how you improved).	3	2/15/2022
		This class was only difficult due to the professor. Professor David Hinckley is not a good professor. You don't learn anything in this class because he just talks about his personal life all the time and when you get your grade back it's just negative comments. All my essays were reviewed and revised by students who tested out of English 1C and students who are passed the course but this professor gave me F's for all my essays and the revised ones. The only positive note I can say about him is the fact he lets us revise our essays for a better grade but if you want to actually learn something and a fair professor, pick someone else. 	10	3/22/2022
		"Not particularly sure why but I found this class to be very time consuming. Took it with Jacelyn Vasquez, and while the class itself wasn't particularly difficult, for some reason I found myself extremely busy because of it. The problem is that, even though it is not a ""difficult"" class, it is still intellectually demanding. I was unbelievably busy and stressed the quarter I took it."	8	10/24/2022
		"I had the class with Dr.David Hinkley, and I'll tell you, he made it so unnecessarily difficult. Throw everything you know about essay formatting out the window, because he makes you change it to ""go in order"" of the book. If there's a chance for you to take ENGL001C and Hinkley is your option, I suggest taking it a different quarter with a different teacher."	10	12/10/2022
		Taken fall 2022 w/ Aran Park. She is not mean but assigns a lot of reading (&pop quizzes) and long essays so the class was time consuming and kinda scary as a freshman. Go to office hours for essay help! Final project was partly a group project:((( The class itself was about fairy tales so it felt unnecessarily demanding at times. Also she wouldn’t fully excuse an assignment even with a doctors note. Grading was quite harsh; really hard to get an A, and it was all graded very last minute so I had absolutely no idea how I was doing. 	6	12/22/2022
ENGL004	6.04	Great biases in class and a C+ is very normal don't expect to be getting any A's this class was harder than 1a and 1b	9	4/3/2017
		I had Dr. Van Zandt and enjoyed every class. The essay topics were very enjoyable and the class discussions were very interesting. 10/10 would take class again	3	12/19/2017
		Do not slack in this class. Try your best on every essay since professors (maybe just mine) mark every little thing.	7	3/25/2018
		The teacher (Reminded us she was not a professor yet) graded harshly due to the fact that no one participated in the class. Once students she got to know her, she good feedback. Do the work ahead of time, listen to feedback and participate makes the class easier. Essays play a huge part in getting that A. Homework and points do count sometimes. 	6	8/24/2018
		Grades are almost all dependant on essays. Can be a difficult class.	7	12/15/2018
		Prof. Schnarr was nice and overall an understanding professor. If you go to office hours she'll basically write the essay with you. 	4	12/17/2018
		I took the class with Dr. Potter and he made it enjoyable. Just don't mess up on the 4 essays and you wont have to worry as much for the final. Everything is marked for all the professors in this course, so an A isn't expected. Also, one essay is allowed a revision. 	3	12/19/2018
		Had Potter as my professor. Put in a lot of work on my essays going to the arc 2 or 3 times per an essay just to get a C on all my essays. This class destroyed my gpa. Currently in ENGL001A and I have an A so avoid Potter at all costs.	9	3/1/2019
		Snyder grades WAY to hard, it’s incredibly difficult to get A’s straight off the bat 	6	12/10/2019
		4 essays and a final	6	12/20/2019
		"I took ENGL004 with Julia Brett. She is a very nice person and on the older side. I wouldn't recommend her because she did not teach how to write good essays or use the ""Write It"" textbook at all. She primarily wanted us to focus reading Ecotopia which was not interesting to me. The only good thing I could say is that I didn't have to buy the ""Write It' textbook."	8	2/25/2020
		There are 4 essays and a final. I had Prof.Brett she was easy but this class is very grammar heavy so make sure your grammar is up to par. She lets you revise one essay which is so great. Also you need to do online grammar and reading exercises which is just busy work.	7	5/11/2020
		I had it with Albert Anthony and he's a pretty nice prof. He really wants to help you improve and if you put in the effort, you should be fine. He tries to make jokes during class and might even bring out his parrot. He does kinda give a lot of work and there's 4 essays, but he guides you through it and you could always go to office hours for help.	5	10/29/2020
		Had Stefan Torralba and he is a really considerate and helpful teacher. He really wants to help and make you a better writer. Take advantage of his generosity by asking for feedback and really incorporating it into your writing. A lot of students did not care to go to his optional rough draft help office hours and they suffered. 	6	11/30/2020
		No one gets an A in this class lmao. Grading is super harsh no matter what professor you get. 4 essays and 1 final in total. 	9	12/14/2020
		I had Karen Polster, and she was amazing!! The class consisted of 4 essays + the final. She's super nice and really wants to help you pass the class. The essays are easy, especially since she tells you exactly what you need to do to get A's on them. I found the class to be pretty easy, but the final was a little bit tough. 	6	12/18/2020
		Professor Smedley is  clear on what to do on essays you just need to make sure you follow the essay requirements like a good directed summary	6	12/22/2020
		Had Professor Julie Cline and imo I think it was okay other than the fact that there everything is kinda rushed. There are 4 essays and she did have one quiz. She didn't give any explanation on certain essays and expected us to know the hidden meaning behind it then would call us out if we focused too much on the wrong thing. She assigns additionally reading and work but never goes over it in class so there is no point of really doing it. Wasn't aware that ENGL004 was harder than 1A/1B but this is a class you get placed in based on the writing placement test so i dont suggest actually taking this class 	7	11/15/2022
		Had Dr. Cummins, nice professor but harsh grader. Picky about grammar but you can pass if you put in the work.	7	12/9/2022
		I had Todd Luce. I recommend participating in class discussions which will reflect a little bit on the harshness of your essay grading and his flexibility with deadlines. There are random 1-point assignments and quizzes twice a week, I did not do over half of them and did not try in the class because essays carry the grade for the class. So you can just not do any hw or readings and as long as you ace your essays you should get an A. 	1	12/11/2022
		I took this class with Benedict Jones Winter 2022. He was understanding but you need to do the work in order to be able to reach out to him. His assignments are very helpful towards the essay. You do need to show up to class though, to get a passing grade. He's thorough and very helpful. 	6	12/27/2022
		Harder than ENGL 001A and 001B	5	1/31/2023
ENGL01PA	8.00	"Had Potter Fall quarter 2022. A super difficult teacher, never gave As. He doesn't want you to be creative (it's not a creative writing class) but at the same time he wants it to be unique and engaging. His standards were ambiguous and contradicting. His TA (at the time) was telling us the exact opposite of what Potter was teaching (Potter didn't want us to do the 5-paragraph structured essay and our TA kept telling us to do so).

Overall do not recommend. A very chill class with little homework but the grading was absurd and tanks your GPA."	8	2/24/2023
ENGL01PL	4.00	Dr. Musgrove is a really sweet teacher. The course involved a lot of grammar. You should make sure to be aware of your grammar when your write your essays. There are about five essays including the final which is an essay. I read Antigone and Electra, but she might choose different plays. It's good to get drafts reviewed by her during office hours. 	4	12/18/2019
ENGL012A	3.00	Prof Guenther gave a lot of material each week but most of it was really interesting. We were assigned 3 papers but got to choose 2 of the 3 to complete. If you are interested in the subject then it is great but there is a lot of reading. 	3	2/23/2022
ENGL012B	2.00	Online Summer course with Francisco Ramos. Very laid back professor. He grades mostly on effort of your assessments. There were 4 assignments, each being 1 - 2.5 pages (MLA format). For the online course we only had to attend class once a week. You could honestly get away with not readings or modules. Not sure how much will change once we go back to in person classes but he practically hands out A's. Textbook is given for free by professor along with any other reading materials. 	2	9/30/2021
ENGL012I	2.00	Taken with Josh Pearson- It's a really fun class! You can get away without doing the reading (about 2-3 short stories a week) but you'll have trouble following the discussion. There's a few papers that aren't too bad (and he frequently pushes the due date later.)	3	11/18/2019
		Super interesting class that defines a lot of different subgenres of science fiction literature. The professor is very passionate and humorous about the subject he teaches. He has all kinds of knowledge. He's also easy going. There is a lot of reading, but nothing too much.	1	12/13/2019
ENGL012R	3.00	Prof Gutierrez is great, and if you're interested in Chicano theory at all you'll love this class. The only assignments are journals every week, and class time just consists of watching presentations by other students (you also have to present at least once in the quarter btw). Attendance isn't mandatory, and she uploads recordings of the lectures later on for whoever needs it. One essay at the end of the quarter and that was it. Really cool professor, also really flexible with deadlines if you need a bit of extra time.	3	3/17/2021
ENGL017	2.00	Had Professor Kenny.  Really nice lady and easy multiple choice exams.  Take good notes and try to read as much of the plays as possible and you'll be fine.	3	3/30/2017
ENGL020A	4.00	Professor Brayman's really nice and is passionate about what she teaches, but she tends to drone on during lectures. Some of the readings for this class can be pretty hard, but she at least gives you most of them. Midterm for this class was tricky, and most didn't really pass it. Essays are pretty toughly graded, but grades are consistently updated on iLearn.	8	12/14/2019
		WINTER 2022 (Half online and half in-person) Dr. Kenny is super nice, and the course is so easy and fun. No exam and final. You read British literature (4 books) and we discuss them in class. Quizzes are take-home (on canvas) and just the things on the reading, if you are lazy just google them and they are all up there. The final project is just creating artwork and writing an artist statement on it. This class is a free A+. This is Dr. Kenny's first time teaching this course. I recommend taking any other course with her if possible. 	2	3/17/2022
		All you have to do it keep up with reading the poems, Professor Long and his TA's are very gracious graders when it comes to the midterm and final 	1	11/14/2022
		Had Emma Stapely and she's great! She's a lovely instructor and you can tell she LOVES talking about whatever she's teaching. I will say though, it's sometimes hard to follow along if you're trying to take notes because she seems to read off a very elaborate script. But, I didn't read any of the books besides just using an online summary tool and got 100% on every single essay. Just google quotes or something and you'll be fine. So long as you answer the prompt (at least for my TA, Loren Barbour), you get full credit	5	3/22/2023
ENGL020B	3.00	Took it with Robyn Johnson, Summer 2022. Really chill class overall. It's a pretty easy pass if you don't care but if you actually put in a little effort and try to understand the readings this is an easy A to boost your GPA.	3	8/16/2022
ENGL020C	3.00	a lot of readings but i never did them, cancelled midterm and final, just 2 papers for final and midterm 	3	6/4/2019
		Took this course with Professor Jennifer Doyle. She's such an understanding professor in the sense that she knew her students had much harder courses for their schedules. As a result, she changed the original structure of the course from: 10% reading exam, 20% difficulty assignment, 30% discussion participation, 25% final essay, and 15% reading exam, to the same format but converting the two reading exams into Notes Submission (Credit/No Credit). The way she structures the prompts is that there is no correct idea, as long as you are able to relate the core concepts and theories with the assigned readings. She genuinely wants her students to succeed. Lectures sparked in-class discussions that engaged everybody with the difficult concepts.	3	6/13/2019
		Took it with Professor Doyle (Fall 19). Super easy. she does not believe in 'grading', so she has a list of assignments that you can do. Once you turn in the assignments you get the points no matter what. 75 points was from the assignments list, and another 25 is from an reflection essay, attendence, and a plan of what assignments you were going to do. She didn't tell people that attendence was being taken for credit, so not a lot of people showed up to lecture. So a lot of people lost points for no attendence. On another note, the class structure was constantly changing, so it was slightly confusing. This also means there is a good chance the class might be a bit different next quarter. 	1	12/10/2019
		Never went to lectures and got an A+. I had Jennifer Doyle. She's really funny and entertaining so if you aren't the type to want to skip class, you won't suffer at all. She's also very understanding and gives good feedback on homework. You get to choose which homework assignments you do and there are no finals or midterms. Her homework is also based on participation not actual content. If you actually follow directions, you'll get full credit. And as long as you do a decent amount of the homework or at least one's that are worth a lot of points and one of the graded essays, you'll get an A.	2	2/29/2020
		Took with Stapely online bc of quarantine. Highly recommend, super easy and written assignments were short (3 pgs max). An easy A as long as you complete every assignment.  2 discussion posts each week based on readings. 	2	6/3/2020
		"I had Dr. James Tobias. He is very kind and caring, he tries his best to make the class easier on students, emphasizing how ""quizzes don't do much, but a research paper will help you in the real world."" He teaches very interesting subjects, sometimes he talks a lot, and gives a lot of information. It is important to attend class but you don't need to write about every subject he talks about, though they are connected and will give you many ideas about what to write about. The TA I had was super helpful,  so I am not sure what it is like to take this course without a good TA. There is a lot of reading and writing, and the writing is pretty difficult, however, you just have to be organized and keep a good schedule and it should not be too hard to complete. Grade depends mostly on TA, professor is open to questions and likes to be challenged/ asked questions or when students bring up topics for discussion. "	7	12/20/2020
ENGL102W	8.00	Professor Nunley is trash. Peep his RMP. Don't take this class under any circumstances 'cus guy does NOT know how to teach. His tests are cruel and he cannot explain HIS OWN essay prompts, point blank period. Completely disorganized.	10	3/19/2019
		Wasn’t too bad. Had to write 5,000 words total this quarter but it was broken up into mini weekly 500 word assignments. All on Hamlet though 	6	3/19/2021
ENGL128X	4.00	The class focused on the works of Toni Morrisson so it was really interesting reads. With Professor Nunley, there are no writing assignments, just a midterm and a final. It is very important that you pay very close attention to what he says in class as in his tests he will have questions about things he mentions briefly in his lectures. He gives extra credit the more you participate/ talk in class which is a bonus!	4	6/2/2021
ENGR001	1.17	Literally just show up, get credit. 	1	3/28/2017
		You just have to show up to class.	1	1/11/2019
		Don't skip classes as that's the only thing you have to do to get an A in the class. Pretty useful class for a 1 unit class. You learn a lot and Professor LePendu is amazing.	1	12/12/2019
		Hardly a class aside from the weekly homework. Make sure you go to class and do the homework, otherwise you will fail the class. I had professor LePendu and he was a beast	2	12/13/2019
		"Had Paea. ""Mandatory"" attendance (just get someone to send you the attendance link). Weekly homework that takes 20 - 30 min tops. No final or midterm. "	1	12/14/2019
ENGR101	2.50	just show up to class. Not even really, becuase there were no in-class activities or anything. Just 3 homeworks, and a final. The 3rd year equivalent of ENGR001. Once a week for one hour. What else do you want me to say?	2	12/13/2017
		Show up, learn about industry stuff, leave. Took it with Payne. We had some homework (not that hard) and a final. The final was only hard because none of us really studied for it.	3	12/22/2017
ENGR108	See HIST108

ENGR118	4.00	With prof. K barsanti, this class is easy if you habe programming experience, (understand function calls, executions, declarations, and how to work with arrays) if you dont then it will set you back, lectures are boring she reads off the powerpoint and always be in class cause she gives clicker and it counts toward grade, skim through the book for more pointers on the numerical methods, not a hard class but Barsanti is new and very disorganized at times	5	12/20/2017
		Take Dr. Toan to learn MATLAB or Take Dr. Barsanti for easy A. 	5	9/23/2018
		If you take Barsanti, you might notice that she does not know any matlab. 	3	12/10/2019
		Barsanti is an easy A if you know MATLAB. If you don't know, work with the TA as much as possible. HW/MATLAB grader can be a pain. Though, her class is a bit unorganized and you'll see that she doesn't know MATLAB too well. 	4	12/22/2020
		If you have coding experience this class is a joke. It's literally basic applied calculus with MATLAB as the tool for approximating solutions. If you can understand for loops and function calls you will ace the class. The TA will carry you if you go to lab sections, which were optional attendance for fall 2021 (but you needed to do the assignments given in lab for credit).	3	1/27/2022
ENGR171	2.50	Easy shit, just make sure you have a good group for your project. Class is 30% quizzes from the videos, 70% is the project grade. Easy A if put a modicum of work into the project	1	11/12/2019
		The homework is easy, but the existential dread isn’t.	4	2/22/2023
ENGR180W	3.94	Bonni and Sharon. The dynamic duo. This was a great class. I've heard bad things about ENGL001C, this is the alternative for BCOE majors. And it's not that bad either. You can tell both of them are passionate about their topics and like to share their lives with the class. They take turns alternating lectures and present material relevant to life. The first half is pretty much introducing the concepts and exercises, the second half of the class is producing a technical spec to standards. Extra credit is given, both before the midterm and after the midterm. I believe in our quarter 300 extra points could be earned by doing all the extra credit. If you do everything and put in a decent amount of effort, this class shouldn't be too bad. The workshops were often only 30 minutes or less. Time consuming, but difficulty wise not too bad.	3	12/13/2017
		There's a lot of writing in this class and you will work in groups for the quarter-long functional specification project. If you struggle with essays, this might be a challenge. Otherwise, it doesn't require much effort.	4	3/28/2018
		"Overall, the content of the class is super easy, but the professors make it extremely annoying. 

Group Assignments:
PRAY that you're assigned quarter-long group mates that are competent and FUCK YOU if you're the group mate that makes everyone else do all the work :(
Beware the writing guidelines. I can't stress enough, for group assignments make sure all members of your group follow the writing guidelines or everyone in the group loses points. I easily could have gotten an A in the class, but I had to do all of the heavy lifting for 3 other people in my group and couldn't focus on writing my extra credit essays.

Essays:
Long, tedious, and professors are annoyingly strict on their ""writing guidelines"". Very straight forward though. Set aside like a Saturday morning to bang out an essay and you'll be fine.

Extra Credit:
DO ALL EXTRA CREDIT. The class offers so many opportunities to make up any points you lost because of dumb mistakes on assignments. It's entirely possible to skip the written part of the final if you do all of the extra credit."	7	3/30/2018
		This class is so annoying. 1000 word essays due every other week, and they're so nitpicky over every little thing. Do as much of the extra credit as you can to avoid getting out of the final. I did it, but I got less than half the points. It was like one little thing. Sure, I might have missed half the prompt but I should have gotten at least 1 point for what I did write. You'll also be working in groups for a good chunk of it, so make sure you're working with someone who's competent. 	3	6/15/2018
		"Class was a JOKE. Essays were ezpz. Labs were done in under 5 min. Follow the writing guidelines and you're chillin.

The only somewhat difficult part of this class was the presentation. But even that was only five minutes.

Do the extra credit and you can skip part of the final. Fr do it.

Lectures were not suuuper helpful but Bonni and Sharon are kinda cool to listen to.

Easy A. Just do the work and you're fine."	2	6/16/2018
		"The class is easy. Essays are tedious, but for the most part they seem lenient on grading. Just follow the writing guidelines and start early.

Group assignments aren't that bad. The work is much shorter than the essays if everyone does their part. Just make sure that everyone follows the writing guidelines and does their part correctly. My group was competent overall, so we got away with doing assignments during the day they were due, but if you don't trust your group you should start early.

Do all the extra credit. You can skip the written portion of the final entirely if you get all the points from them. The written portion was around 3,500 words for my class. It's still not fun to do even if you have over a week to do it. All ECs combined likely have the same word count as the final, but you probably don't want to do this final when you'll have other finals to study for."	4	6/16/2018
		"Class is really easy. It just takes a lot of work. Final is 3,500 words. Midterm is 1,500 words. Week 0 you're assigned a 1,000 word essay. There's presentations, homework like weekly, etc. It's just very tedious to do but not difficult whatsoever (unless English is not your first language, then you might be in some trouble). Just make sure you follow their guidelines religiously. They will dock your grade mercilessly for each assignment if you don't follow their rules. 
Also, there is group work and a stand-up presentation involved. The group is assigned in like week 2 or something and you work with them until week 10. If you get lazy/inattentive group members like I did, your grade will suffer and there's not much you can do about it. You might just have to suck it up and make up for their apathy by doing twice the work. The groups are assigned randomly and you cannot switch members, barring extreme circumstances like a member is straight up refusing to do anything, etc."	1	12/17/2018
		"Follow the writing guidelines and you'll do great. There is only one large assignment (presentations around midterms) and everything else is pretty easy. If you're up for it, do all the extra credit offered. It should let you skip the final, which is a huge 3000 word essay. Bonni and Sharon can be a bit much, but if you can ignore their ""LOOK WE'RE OLDER THAN YOU AND THEREFORE KNOW MORE THAN YOU"" attitude, the class is entertaining enough."	3	3/29/2019
		Pay extremely close attention to every rule they mention. It's obvious what they want, but if you don't do it then your grade will suffer	3	6/15/2019
		Sharon and Bonni are good profs who know what they're talking about. The course isn't hard, but luckily you learn a good deal of work advice. As long as you submit your assignment with on time with the correct file name, you'll be fine.	3	6/9/2021
		It's a lot of writing. Follow their guidelines on the writing requirements and do ALL the extra credit. Easy A.	2	6/15/2021
		Like others have said above, just pray you get paired with people that actually follow their writing guidelines otherwise your grade will suffer in the group assignments as a result. Do as many of the extra credit assignments as you possibly can so you can skip one or two essays on the final and start writing those final essays as early as possible. As long as you follow their writing guidelines you should be in good shape. And make sure you name your files properly, you don't want to end up like my partner who did 1500 words worth of extra credit just to get no points because he forgot to change the file name. 	6	6/21/2021
		If you do all the extra credit and follow writing guidelines you will get an A. Bonni and Sharon have the most entertaining lectures and while the rules for the class seem odd, they are easy to follow.	5	12/10/2021
		One of the most tedious and time consuming courses I have ever taken in my entire life. The amount of work you have to do is ridiculous, and around the last week is absolute nightmare.Also you cant choose your partners, so you better pretty you get paired with someone who is a competent writer. 	6	12/5/2022
		"Look, you're just going to have to learn to suck it up with Bonnie and Sharon. This means absolutely no complaining or whining because it will just hurt you. They are the only people that are teaching 180W at UCR.
When they grade your writing, they can accuse of you absolutely anything and you can't really do anything about it. They will have a fair share of criticism to give you. Remember to follow the writing guidelines they give you, and naming convention of your file.
There is a group project that you will do throughout the entire class, and hopefully you get paired with a good team. If you don't get a good group, you may be in trouble.
It's relatively easy to pass the class, just don't be a pain in the butt. Do every extra credit assignment they throw at you, and you can skip the final.

I also want to add that these two are woke. You'll get deducted if you aren't inclusive to all groups. Godspeed to anyone taking these two."	5	2/26/2023
		A lot of assignments with Bonnie and Sharon but it's pretty easy to get an A if you follow the guidelines closely. 	6	5/26/2023
ENSC001	2.00	Easy Class with Professor Volz	3	12/5/2019
		Easy af go to discussion for debates and participation points and go to lecture for participation points. READ THE SLIDES ALL TESTS ARE STRAIGHT UP FROM THE SLIDES.  	2	12/15/2019
		No essays, two exams, and a final. There's also no homework other than discussion section debates, which are really easy too. Professor Volz shows he knows what he talks about really well and is easy to understand. There's extra credit if you win the debates in your discussion section. The exams are literally just copy pasted from the slides he shows in class, so if you read over the slides you should be fine. The final is made up of around 80 questions from the past two exams and a few from the lectures that were left. I finished the class with 102% and I'm pretty sure the average for the final was around a 94%. By far the easiest class I could've ever taken.	2	2/11/2020
		Two debates in discussion, but they are easy. Two midterms and a final, you get two attempts on them.	2	11/20/2020
		Lectures were asynchronous. The debates we have to do as work are really interesting and pretty fun. It kept everyone engaged. Professor also provided a lot of info on his lecture slides so that was very helpful. Exams are all on things mentioned on slides so it's very easy.	2	12/28/2020
		Had Volz and was easy. the midterms/final was open note and all the info on the slides was on the midterm and final 	2	3/16/2021
		Easy class but how 94% is an A- and not an A in this class I will never know	3	12/12/2021
		Easiest class ever	1	12/28/2021
ENSC002	6.00	Do not take with professor Yates unless you're a environmental science major (and esp. if you're a CHASS major, stay away!). Extremely difficult exams and she purposely will try to trick you. Pretty rude. If you're late my one min. to the exam, she will give you a 0. This happened to a few people the first exam. 3 cumulative exams, and final is cumulative but optional. No textbook for the class, only PPT slides. Mandatory lectures through the usage of Kahoot. 	8	5/2/2018
		Honestly the content is pretty straightforward and easy if you pay attention to lectures, but if you don't then the content might be kinda tricky to remember. We had the class online so both midterms and final was online (open notes and book). But overall pretty easy class if you put in effort. 	4	3/20/2022
		Took it with Professor Peter Homyak during Winter '23 the class required attendance through pollseverywhere and tests were 50 qs multiple choice with 100 qs for the final ! The professor was super passionate about the course though very lecture heavy and homework was mainly preparing for discussion debate and reading the textbook! Only offers 1 extra credit through a 1 page essay on a debate topic reflection that counts for the participation portion of the overall grade! Midterm averages were around 66% but dropped the lowest of the 2 and final was around 68.2%.	6	3/23/2023
ENSC006	5.80	Didn't really learn much and the TA just gave answers to the homework. Midterm and final are kind of hard but heavily graded. Choose the participation type grading and go to every class and you should be ok. But only take the class if you really need to	7	2/5/2019
		Professor Foster Tellez is so nice. Overall grade is extremely curved. Just make sure to attend lectures & discussions since they do kahoot for attendance points. Choose the grading scale of homework/attendance/exams instead of only exams.	4	6/16/2019
		If not for the generous curve my grade wouldn't have looked so pretty. Edgar Tellez-Foster lets you choose between midterm and final being the only parts that matter or incorporating clickers into your grade. I recommend choosing clickers bc he curves the class if you have >80% on it. 	7	12/15/2019
		Make sure to study and just understand what he teaches because the midterm and final heavily rely on application of concepts you learn in class. 	7	12/17/2019
		Class isnt hard but prof ryan rusich can be rude. The lowest exam was dropped. You have to buy a book by Jaron Lanier because all of the homework is based on it, but it isnt expensive. Attend class and the exams wont be hard because he talks about everything on the exam. The labs were pretty easy too.	4	9/10/2020
ENSC100	4.50	Sam Ying is by far one of the best professors/instructors I've had. I highly recommend. Overall the material can be slightly difficult but the midterms/finals are easy money. 	5	12/15/2019
ENSC105	5.00	Took this with Andrew Gray. There's heavy emphasis on reading scientific research, so if that's not your cup of tea, you won't enjoy the class as much. Definitely study the lectures since he bases the exam questions off them. Due dates for assignments + projects are very lenient, even if submitted late. Overall, easier than ENSC 101	5	6/7/2020
ENSC120	6.00	Midterm is pretty long but the final is simpler (still long tho). Grading is fair as long as you study in detail. Most of the info is in Dr. Hopkins' slides and lots is repeated throughout the quarter. Pay attention to examples that are talked about in class, and you'll be fine. Also, there is a teabag group project to do throughout the quarter so keep up with that and just make the presentation and paper p thorough.	6	12/30/2019
		I took this class online with Stouthamer. It is insanely difficult. He curves the class so that only the top 10% of students will get an A. If this specific course is not recommended for your major, I strongly urge you to avoid this class. There's a lot of memorization.	9	2/24/2021
		Professor Stouthamer expects you to memorize a LOT. The midterms were pretty tricky, weekly homework and quizzes	7	3/1/2021
ENTM020	1.00	Dr Baer is one of the kindest, most caring, and best professors I have ever had! I took this class online so unfortunately we didn't get to work with the bees but I still learned so much. Midterm and final were very comprehensive (take-home), and lectures were very interesting. Each student has to present a research paper to the class and the presentations went quite well for everyone. If you're looking to take a good life science elective or simply learn more about these cute little creatures, take this class!	1	7/21/2020
ENTM060W	3.50	This class is super good! It is always small so you meet the professor and get a connection. It is a really good classs to learn how to read and write research and better than english 001c and you get credit for it! I love the class so much and it was such a good experience! 	3	2/20/2021
ENTM100	5.00	Paine is a great prof and gives extra credit opportunities. Most enjoyable class I have ever taken.	5	7/7/2017
		Perring is a fun prof, but very lecture heavy. Study study study your insect orders!! 	5	12/30/2020
ENTM126	4.00	Dr.Murillo was a super nice and involved lecturer. Take this class if you definitely like topics such as parasitology or pathology. One of the most interesting classes I have taken at UCR. 	4	3/13/2021
ENTM162	See BIOL162			
ETST001	2.63	No final, no midterm 	1	3/28/2017
		i had macias. extremely boring professor, but the midterm and final are just a take home essay. you can get away with not going to lectures, just make sure you’re on top of the readings.	4	2/5/2018
		Took it with Andrea Smith. No exams at all. Just had to take notes during lecture and turn them in. Also had really short essays due every week, but those were pretty easy.	1	11/21/2018
		No need to go to lecture easy A, prof. macias	1	3/24/2019
		So the other guy said that the midterm/final were take home, they weren't. Professor Macias is pretty bad at lecturing so lecture isn't necessary but make sure to go to discussion, theres attendance and quizzes. Course readings weekly, midterm is write an essay with a notecard for sources and final was the same but no notecard. Course content isn't too bad. Just read the stuff and have a general idea of what's going on in the course and you should pass. Lots of people take this as an elective so you can S/NC if you really want to.	4	3/24/2019
		Andrea Smith is an easy professor	2	12/10/2019
		do not take w najera!!! she was so bad and unprofessional too! one time a couple guys weren't paying attention and couldn't answer a question so she kicked them out of lecture..but yeah this class is lowkey a trap bc ppl say it's easy but tbh it's kinda a lot of work	7	6/2/2020
		(COVID ERA) Easiest A+ next to dance 5, you only have to do essays each week but you get full credit as long as u try. No midterm or finals.	1	4/22/2021
ETST002	4.86	No homework, just midterm/final/discussion attendance. Was pretty easy as long as you put in some effort.	1	6/28/2017
		They randomly take attendance in the lecture hall or put films and make you turn it in at the end of class; make sure to attend film days. One midterm and final. Teacher's and TA's are kind of unclear about what we are supposed to study for.	7	3/5/2018
		Lopez made us write four short papers and counted attendance occasionally.  The midterm and final were a joke.  He posted study guides on ilearn.	2	4/2/2018
		with prof najera, 2 reading analyses & 1 annotated bib (instead of midterms and a final), attendance is taken with clicker questions, and attendance is taken in section. super easy as long as you just do the work and show up	2	3/25/2019
		Professor Felix was teaching this course. The course only required two essays, one midterm which is an essay and a final essay. The class was very straight forward. 	2	6/17/2019
		Intro to Chicano’s super easy the professor Anthony Macias really boring. Never went to class just discussion make sure to read at least 2 readings before the midterm and final and you should get an A 	1	5/26/2020
		I had Chicano Studies with Professor Gonzalez and his lectures were conversation-style where there wasn't much to go off the slides. There are a LOT of readings for this class to the point where I stopped even checking them anymore. You have to submit a 2-page single spaced response paper every single week. The grading is quite lenient on this, so if you just do your papers and get participation points then you should be fine.	4	11/25/2020
		Took with Gonzales during Covid-era... grade is made up of weekly writing assignments(1.5-2 pages single spaced), participation, and one community participation write-up. Not an easy A if you're prone to skipping class or find it difficult speaking up because participation is a large chunk of the grade, but no exams is a big Plus & this class is great if you love something discussion-based. Pretty inconsistent reading (some weeks had really dense material, or just a lot of pages, some were just short articles), but all interesting. 	3	12/26/2020
		The rate my professor ratings dont  lie. 	10	3/15/2021
		The readings, assignments and tests were not hard at all. The professor on the other hand does not teach at all, and spends all class time venting about personal past problems. Don't take his class.	10	3/15/2021
		I took Professor Enrique Lopez's Intro to Chicano Studies class in the winter quarter of 2021. There is no structure at all for this class. The lectures are all over the place. There are no slides or lecture outlines, just him ranting about Chicano history and stuff. Also, he requires our camera to be on for attendance purposes, and most of us just woke up. The readings, though short, are shared through blurry jpgs, so they are tedious to read.   His assignments are film review essays. He makes us watch hour-long documentaries and write about it with a very vague prompt.  Honestly, I learned more from those documentaries than I ever did in his class. He also expects us to email him the assignments instead of having us submit them on ilearn. One of my assignments got lost in his spam folder! He takes his sweet-ass time grading assignments.The midterms and finals are just as bad as the assignments, except the TAs are grading them so each TA has their own guidelines. At least they are take-home. The timeline of this class is also very messed up. Our first assignment is assigned on week 5. Our midterm is on week 7, the same day a homework assignment is due.  Our last assignment is due the day of finals, and also can be submitted hours after the final is due.  This class would work much better asynchronous. Do yourself a favor. Do not take this class. Take a different ethnic studies class. Take Asian-American studies or African American Studies or religion. If you decide to be brave and take this class, take it with friends, join group chats, and have a solid support system. You're going to need it.	9	3/15/2021
		Do Not. I repeat Do Not!! Take this class with Enrique Lopez. He is super unorganized. Made class mandatory but talks in tangents and doesn’t go over much material assigned. Class work is not hard but his grading scale is weird. Changes information often. He took a month to grade papers.No rubric. Your TA will make or break your grades. 	5	3/15/2021
		Graded on 3 papers with Professor Felix and lectures were optional!	2	1/6/2023
ETST003	7.00	Avoid Professor Ariane Dalla Dea. She is the most disastrously unorganized professor I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. Without the TAs, I would not have done well in this class. There was no structure to the class or her lectures, and all her essays lacked a prompt or grading criteria. Also, we received our midterm and essay grades the day after the final, so you did not how you were doing until it was too late.	6	4/3/2017
		Readings are super hard and confusing, there are quizlets out there that do help for the exams though. Teacher himself is not useful, he just goes over his slides that he posts on iLearn. Took it with Paul Green. Trust ur TAs and ask them for help if you need and search google/quizlet for help :)	8	12/13/2019
ETST005	3.00	This class was a joke and an easy A! 	1	9/17/2017
		For an ethnic studies class this class was pretty annoying. If your looking for the easiest A possible just take race.	5	12/12/2018
		This is not a class that you can get an easy A in. You actually have to do the readings in order to get some form of understanding on what's being asked. This is important as the take home midterms/final would be asking for specific examples from the readings. Be prepared to read at least 80+ pages a week, too.	8	6/15/2019
		Edward Chang; Easy A depending on your TA. He was very cranky and couldn't accommodate online. There's no doubt in my mind that he is passionate in what he does, but he has a really bad attitude towards the class. He has blocked people from zoom (to join his class) because they were a few minutes late. When he finishes lectures early, before we can ask questions or anything, he ends the meeting. He seems like he hates it online.	3	6/21/2021
		loved this class, professor, and TA so much. Tanaka and Lawrence Lan are very passionate about this class and it makes you more intrigued about asian american studies. i don’t think there was any homework, only one “midterm” project and one MC final. the project could be individual or group and you get to choose the topic. final was easy peasy. love love loved this class (took this summer 22)	1	12/17/2022
ETST007	2.00	Perez is a cool professor. Lectures are laid back and almost never have a lot of notes, if any. The midterm and final are in-class essays and you get to have some notes with you. Pretty interesting class overall	2	3/27/2019
		Krisha Hernandez was by far the most unorganized instructor I’ve ever had. Completely clueless and taught through YouTube videos. However, this class was essentially full credit, easy 100%, if you showed up to every class. Literally got 100 on the midterm just for turning it in on time. Absolute joke of a class	1	12/10/2019
		I took Gerald Clarke (online), very good speaker and the class was overall not hard. If you need a chill class, take this class with Professor Clarke.	3	12/2/2021
		Online Covid/Zoom time: Super easy I didn't even do the readings (they were long, interesting, but you didn't have to do them to pass) 1 research paper on a tribe TA Micheal super easy grader it's an easy glass and Prof Gerald Clarke was really interesting and teaches you a lot he's funny too	2	12/17/2021
		Really easy class (I took Gerald Clarke), just go to lecture even though you don't really have to since they're recorded, but the professor is such a good speaker and passionate about the subject, you're going to be missing out. Grades was based on a few discussions, 1 essay paper, and a final. 10 questions were given to you prior to the final, only 3 shows up on the actual final.	2	1/3/2022
ETST011	4.00	"I took this class with Professor Leonard. As a first year who has 0 interest in linguistics and about ethnic studies in general, I won't recommend it as an ""easy pass"" class. Lots of reading needs to be done, a 6 page autobiography, and you WILL NOT PASS THE EXAMS if you didn't do any of the reading. Not necessary to attend lecture, but you're required to attend discussion. You'll definitely learn in this class, but if you're lazy like , good luck."	4	12/18/2019
ETST012	2.00	Easy class except for the final essay, absolute cakewalk for STEM majors looking to take an easy breadth class	2	12/12/2021
ETST012H	3.00	Took this with Lucia during Covid Winter 2021 and it was a pretty easy class for honors. Everything was prerecorded and the discussion was just a discussion post every week. The class was on Canvas and really easy to navigate through. 2 mandatory office hour meets with your TA and a final paper (definitely start early). Final was open note and proctored on zoom and was pretty difficult so definitely take notes throughout the course. 	4	3/29/2021
ETST014	5.00	The hardest section was Africa; all the music sounds the same so it makes it hard to differentiate between them for listening questions. The term paper is really easy just do it before the last week so you don't rush	5	12/18/2017
ETST098	4.00	Very easy class. There are weekly short answer responses based on documentaries or movies (about 1000 words), and she only requires that you turn in 5 of the 7 assigned. Final exam is take home and pretty easy if you refer to the readings. Discussion section weekly assignments are super easy, too, and Adam Tyson is the best TA! Professor Shiekh is kinda blunt and sometimes calls students out in a rude way, but the class is easy and lectures are fine. 	4	6/15/2022
ENTM010	7.75	Took it with Redak. This man expects too much out of you. STAY AWAY. Way too much memorization, exams are super hard and he does not care for his students. 	9	6/2/2020
		Concepts aren't difficult, but heavy memorization. Reminds me of Bio 5B but insects and somewhat easier. Weekly quizzes and hw (basically another quiz) on ilearn based on this week's and last week's material. They're straightforward and open note. There were 3 mts instead of mt + final. Thought this was good bc I'd die if there was a fat cumulative final.  I'm a BCOE major who took this in winter 2021 with Stouthamer online as a filler class...do NOT do this. Registered bc I'm interested in insects and need 12 units but it became my least favorite class ever because of the professor. Lectures prerecorded and sucks the life out of me even at 1.5x speed.  He also grades based on bell curve, so that the 60-90 percentile students are in B range. Cool, right? No, not cool when you're at the 60% percentile with a 86% overall in class. Your grade heavily depends on how well your peers are doing. Rip gpa over some stupid grasshoppers. 	7	3/17/2021
		Took this with Stouthamer during COVID, interesting material but professor is unorganized and does not care about the students. TAs are just as confused as you and Stouthamer does not provide a study guide for exams but expects a lot from his students - especially for an intro class. There is a lot of memorization and information is very specific. Grading scale is also all over the place, would not take again!!	8	3/28/2021
		I took this class in the spring 2022 with prof Redak, it is honestly heavy on memorization. You need to rewrite your notes a couple of time in order to memorizes them. But the material is very easy so just do not miss any lectures or discussion because you will fall behind. Overall, prof Redak makes the class fun. 	7	6/18/2022
ENTM020	4.00	"I took this course with Boris Bar. Such a sweet and understanding professor so take it with him! It's a relative small class and that affects the structure of the class. Lecture and discussion are usually on the same day and attendance is mandatory. Lecture is early in the day and covers the basis of the bees and beekeeping. Although, the professor does upload the lecture slides, they are not helpful at all. I suggest going to lecture and taking notes because he is more of a verbal person. Discussion is solely based on student presentations about scientific articles. Since it is the only thing covered on that day, the presentations are a big part of your grade. However, the professor and TA know that the majority of the students who take this course are not CNAS majors. So they understand if someone has difficulty doing the reading and the presentation and won't hold it against you. For lab, you get to explore the bees habitat (which is the fun part) you get to suit up in a beekeeper suit and work with the bee hives. The TA, other beekeepers from the lab, and Bar and his wife (who is also an entomologist) are present to help students. At the end of the course, you get to make honey and beeswax candles to take him as goodies. 
There is a midterm that was take home. The final is cumulative, but it's not bad if you took good notes since the majority is just memorization. If not, there is quizlets online on this class that will definitely help you. Overall, a good class "	4	1/7/2020
ETST102	1.00	Took it over the summer. Every day we were assigned 3-4 readings and we just had to respond to one of them. Each response was 5% of our grade. 8 different reading assignments, so 40% total is just responding to readings.  Participation was 25% and it was just chiming in every now and then when she asks a broad question mid lecture.  Final was 35% and was just a big essay.  I honestly did it the night before, and sprinkled in some relevant and modern happenings and aced the class.  Very Easy class, and takes out like 3 of your graduation requirements	1	9/13/2020
ETST106	3.00	I took this class with Carol Park. The class is super easy as long as you do the minimal work required. There is reading, but she goes over everything in class that you need to know for the midterm and final.  The midterm and final are mostly essay questions. Attendance is required, but you could probably miss a few classes and make up those days with active participation. However, it is not a good idea to miss any classes as she gives lots of hints as to what will be on the midterm and final. There is a 5-8 page research paper that is due a week before the end of the class, but she assigns it early and is usually pretty simple to complete if you are making continual progress. The professor is pretty interesting to listen to and class is not a bore, whether you agree with what she is saying or not even though the class is mostly her lecturing. (There are some instances where you talk in groups). If you have a breadth class requirement,  I highly recommend you take this class.	3	12/14/2019
		Took with Keith. It was entirely group based except for the final and biweekly reading journal. Professor was super forgiving with the grading and as long as you wrote something related to the material that wasn't total trash you'd usually get most of the points. 	3	3/17/2022
ETST131	3.00	No live or recorded lectures, just slides that are basically quotes from the readings. The class is reading heavy but I did just fine skimming the readings. You make 3 posts on iLearn M-W-F which is a good portion of the grade. There were 4 analysis papers based on film/documentary (everyone received full credit for the last one due to COVID plus the uprisings). Professor Krebs was understanding and quickly adjusted to students needs. Make sure you manage your time well and you’ll do good. 	3	6/8/2020
ETST136	3.00	Professor Carol provided lecture slides that basically summarized the readings for the week. Midterm is based on study slides that she provides. For creative assignment there is an option for 5 min video or regular essay. Term paper based on the two books make sure to read. Overall stay up to date with lecture and materials you should be good. 	3	6/8/2020
ETST189	3.00	The class was boring honestly we had 3 hrs discussions. Make sure to participate, he takes notes on who spoke. Discussions are based on films (1-2 hours) & readings (~30-40 pages) assigned that week. You submit weekly 5 quotes which is like 30% of your grade lol. The final is a term paper based on your selection of films & readings. Reading is very important to do well in the class!! The professor is not understanding of students and kept promoting his book the entire quarter. 	3	6/8/2020
ENVE171	6.00			
FREN002	2.50	Jennifer Ramos is the best French professor, she is fantastic and tests reflect exactly what she teaches. 	2	3/27/2018
		Take with Professor Ramos if you have a chance! She makes the learning environment very comfortable to participate, and is passionate about teaching. She is very funny and strives to make a genuine connection with each student. Lectures are hands-on and participation is vital, but exams are easy. 	3	3/24/2022
FREN003	6.00	Professor Ramos is the best. The class isn't too bad, and shes very forgiving with grading and exams. Attendance is the only annoying thing, since it's 4 days a week and worth a big chunk of the grade lol. The workload is light and she is a really fun teacher. 	6	6/15/2022
FREN004	2.00	Really easy class if you're good with language learning. Even if you aren't, it doesn't require much studying. Also try to take with Jennifer Ramos. She is very approachable and more kind than I can express here...she helped me with both educational and personal issues while I took her class, she will do anything to help her students succeed. Great teacher.	2	3/16/2020
		Christine Duverge is amazing! Her lectures are easy to understand but very interactive and you're able to practice a lot. The weekly homework assignments are very short and there is no class on the day the homework is due. Her exams are take home and are easy, too! She's understanding and kind and is one of the best professors in the French department. 	2	12/22/2022
FREN15A	6.00	"Christine Duvergé is pretty nice overall, but she will be VERY critical of your writing and holds nothing back/does not go easy you, but when you follow her advice she will be very encouraging and your writing will definitely improve. Absolutely DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH DUVERGÉ IF: 1) you don't have a great grasp on French, because it will be a huge amount of work for you (this class is ALL writing and grammar), and/or if 2) you are not ready to basically have a damn therapy session in French, because she wants you to write about your deep feelings/someone who influenced your childhood in a super meaningful way + doesn't accept anything even somewhat surface level. It's annoying as hell honestly, though she says it's so she can ""get to know us."" There are ~1-2 page essays due about every other week and you will use them to construct most of a large final essay at the end. Even if you are ready to do both of the things listed, I don't really recommend this class...."	6	5/15/2020
GBST001	6.00	I had Professor Clark for this class. I enjoyed the class because it talked about relevant topics such as climate change, disease, globalization, and other topics. BUT it was a lot of work and you needed to go to class in order to get the notes. He posts the slides on Canvas, but the slides only have the bullet points of the topics and he talks about the topics. So in order to get the full notes, you have to go to class. The course had a midterm, a final, quizzes based on reading during discussion, and a paper. The paper was fun-ish to write bc you wrote a story using the topics you learned in class with a bit of research/citation included. Overall, would recommend the class if you're willing to do the work. 	6	2/21/2023
GEO001	4.60	Took this class with Gareth Funning. An introductory level course covering physical geology with daily quizzes in iLearn, and weekly readings outlined in syllabus. Professor grades rather harsh on exams, which are all in essay format. Lab final average score was about 68%, so if taking the course, be sure to begin mastering the concepts covered in lab early and often. 	4	12/15/2018
		I had professor Gareth Funning. It's an easy class if you're actually interested in the topics being discussed, i.e. what's a rock and how's it made (how exciting). He doesn't expect you to memorize everything and only really cares about the concepts. There's required textbook reading and an online quiz due before every lecture. The online quizzes are super easy if you glance through the reading and he drops the five lowest quiz scores. There are three midterm essays and two finals essays with the lowest scoring essay dropped. He provides the prompts for the midterm essays a few days in advance (in addition to extra prompts that aren't included on the midterm). Finals prompts are not given in advance, but they are mostly past midterm/finals essay prompts. All essays have multiple prompts to choose from and you are allowed to bring unlimited handwritten index cards. Lab is fun if you like looking about rocks and thinking about how they're formed. As long as you understand and pay attention in every lab, the lab final shouldn't be that hard. 	2	1/5/2020
		Gareth Funning grades the essays hella hard, not as easy of GE as it seems.	5	12/21/2020
		Avoid Gareth Funning. 3 online quizzes a week(4 questions each), 2 essay midterms, and an essay final - but you can use index cards for both. Big issue is the lab class, lectures are no problem. Lectures are done through prerecorded lectures. In class lecture is just going over quiz questions. The lab is horrible. After the info dump of a lecture, in the lab you are expected to be an expert in rocks and processes. After the first lab no one was getting more than a 70% on the labs. They are usually 14 pages long and you have to finish. They are also full of questions that need corrections or further explanations. Professor is super condescending and the lab TA was reluctant to give explanations on lab. 	7	11/22/2021
		2021 Fall, took with Gareth Funning. FOR MIDTERMS: Essays. He gets you to bring notecards to exams and gives out essay prompts ahead of time, choose 3 out of 5 prompts and look through textbook to find stuff to write about, when exam comes just elaborate from your notecard. FOR FINAL: Essays. You can still bring notecards but he doesn't give out prompts. Bring your notecards from the 2 midterms and pray that there'd be a related prompt. FOR LABS: always, ALWAYS, ask TA if you can't identify. They'll tell you pretty much everything.	5	5/4/2022
GEO002	4.00	Tim Lyons is funny and all but he can be a real tool sometimes which made me not want to go to class. That being said, the class is a breeze if you're a STEM major because it's designed for non-math/science majors to fulfill a requirement. Even so, it's not terribly hard considering there is a generous curve. 	3	4/2/2020
		The class is easy if you take excellent notes and make sure you note down whatever the professor speaks during lecture. They drop your lowest midterm as well. 	4	5/8/2020
		Took it with Lyons. Not super complicated, just remembering definitions and concepts about geology. Not the most interesting imo but easy breathd credit. Lab was very zombie (busy) work.	6	5/10/2020
		Had Lyons Winter 2021, he was super sweet and cared a lot abt student success, provided study guides and extra credit opportunities. Attended lecture and labs and got an A. Not too hard if you put in minimal effort.	3	5/22/2021
GEO003	4.00	[COVID-19 SPRING 20] Had this class ONLINE with Aaron Martinez. This class is oriented more towards fossils and evolution instead of pure geology. Attending the Zoom lecture was not required and was more of an office hours. He uploaded multiple short videos a week, breaking down the information into smaller chunks so you don't have to sit and drudge through hour-long videos. There are a lot of different species, characteristics, and time periods to remember, but everything was open book so the class itself was not too hard. 	4	8/26/2020
GEO004	3.38	Took this class with Heather Ford. Online weekly discussion, and HW assignments are worth the same as your midterm. Easy class because she gives tons of EC opportunities and plus, she drops your lowest HW, midterm, and quiz grade. HW takes about 1-2 hours, but it's just busy work. Final project in the end just tests your knowledge of the concepts in the textbook, and it's about the same as the HW. Some of the questions from the midterms + final were confusing because it wasn't something that was on the concept quizzes or HW, but other than that, this class is a good phys. science breadth that'll also boost your GPA 	3	3/22/2018
		Professor Ford is super friendly and funny. Very approachable. She gives a ton of extra credit opportunities throughout the quarter. Probably >95% of what she puts on the tests are in the notes. Her style of notes are easy to understand - but the class gets much harder if you skip lectures. As long as you attend almost every lecture and study minimally you can get an A	4	6/9/2018
		homework and final project were super tedious but you could fail the midterms and still pass the class easily!!	3	6/18/2019
		Dr. Ford is awesome and genuinely cares about her students - she deliberately sets up the class so that it's not hard to get a good grade. Attendance is not mandatory, but lectures are very easy to follow. 1 concept quiz and 1 homework due each week on Monday and Friday respectively (all done through Canvas online), discussions are just helping us with the homework for that week as they can be a bit tedious sometimes. 2 midterms (non-cumulative, 40 questions each) and 1 cumulative final. Your lowest homework, midterm, and concept quiz grades are all dropped. Very low-stress and low-pressure but I honestly learned a lot. Great for an interesting and breather breadth class!	3	3/2/2020
		The material isn't super easy to digest but getting an A in her class was the easiest thing ever. Professor Ford is the sweetest woman out there. She wants her students to do well.	4	6/2/2020
		Took this with Barth during Covid Winter 2021. Honestly wasn't an easy A but if you do the work you can get it. Weekly quizzes are really easy but the weekly homework take a while and they're sometimes difficult because of how specific you have to be. The class uses WebGIS which created some technical difficulties for a lot of people. He uses Yuja proctoring for midterms and the final. He also drops your lower midterm grade and offered an 8% extra credit onto your midterm grade which was really easy to do. The final was cumulative and really hard. 	5	3/29/2021
		Took it half online and half in-person. We had all exams online and professor ford was super understanding on that. There were 3 EC assignments and we can drop 2 lowest hw, 2 lowest quizzes, and one mid-term. She takes one midterm (15% of ur final grade), one final (15%), hws (20%), quizzes (15%), participation (15%), and a final project (20%). Overall you need to memorize a lot of stuff but some of them were common sense. The professor is a nice human being and knows how to teach, super-supportive. I ended up with an A+ and my friend had an A++ cuz those EC bumps lol.	4	3/17/2022
		Took with Heather Ford. 1 dropped homework, 1 dropped quiz, and 1 dropped midterm. Each quiz has two attempts. Just study a bit and watch the lectures.	1	3/27/2022
GEO005	2.25	Taken with Professor Douilly. Class not hard - lots of work though. Think HS science class. Easy A. Lots of intresting movies	3	11/4/2019
		Took this class with Professor Douilly. This class is a breeze if you take notes with the textbook and pay attention in class during lectures. Make sure you do well on the reading, movie, and weekly quizzes which is based on the material you learned that week. While there is no curve in the class, he has a modified grading format which makes it super easy to get a good grade. Also, this class is just really fun in general. Ended the class with an A+ without really trying.	3	12/15/2021
		Took Roby Douilly. Relaxed and organized teacher. Every week there is a short (5-10 question) reading quiz, a short (5-10 Q) movie quiz, and a short (5-10 Q) lecture quiz. There are 10 in total that line up with the weekly topic and movie. 2 lowest reading and movie quiz are dropped. No midterm or final, just 3 exams. Exam 1 and 2 are 50 questions, exam 3 is 100 questions (mixture of info from lectures and readings; will need green scantron). Exams are not comprehensive, they cover a couple topics and do not bleed over into the next exam. Before every exam there is a very helpful exam review sheet. He has every lecture recorded and if you miss something you can just ask him to post it to elearn. 	1	5/27/2022
		typical geoscience class about earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, etc. with movie elements in it in lecture. a couple 50 question scantron midterms and a 100 question final; weekly movie and book assignments, and quizzes on canvas	2	4/5/2023
GEO008	6.25	Starts easy and suddenly gets hard. Tests are way harder than the assignments so study even if you feel confident.	7	11/29/2017
		I found the class to be relatively easy if you have some basic understanding about how earthquakes work. I connected the class with real life (the info is interesting about living in SoCal). The class does get somewhat confusing prior the 2nd midterm but nothing too difficult. The exam midterm and final were similar to one another. Exam heavy weighted class.	5	6/24/2018
		Avoid Professor Ghosh at at costs. The course should’ve been easier than he made it to be but don’t get me wrong. He’s a nice guy and he knows his stuff, he just made it difficult. 	8	1/31/2019
		pay attention in class because sometimes the most obscure things he says will be on the midterm	7	11/13/2019
		The class is super easy before the first midterm, then it suddenly gets insanely hard. Professor Abhijitat is super boring.	8	11/14/2019
		I took this class with Roby. The material gets sorta specific. The movies are ok but he gives an unnecessary amount of work. 	6	2/19/2021
		I took the class Fall 2022 with Prof. Ghosh and he is a very kind professor that is willing to clarify any concepts you are confused on. He assigns reading from a textbook that he uploads on canvas but if you pay attention in lecture and discussions, you don't really need to read it. If your T.A is Shankho, he uploads a recording every week breaking down each question on the activity and basically giving you the answer, so you can easily get 100% on activities. There are two multiple choice midterms and he will drop the lower score and also a multiple choice final. You can find quizlets of the exam online. All the concepts are pretty straightforward and easy to understand but some of the math can get confusing but he provides all the formulas on the exam and you just need to plug in numbers. He also gave 50 extra credit points just to take a photo at an earthquake booth on campus and a photo of you doing duck, cover, hold. I thought it was a pretty interesting class and you can easily get an A.	3	12/1/2022
		Taken with Ghosh, who teaches dry but does what he can. For a lower-div, it goes a notch above in material than it should.  There are better options for breadth.  Easy B, moderate difficulty for A.  Cumulative and repeated questions on tests.  If you struggled in algebra I don’t recommend it.	6	12/10/2022
GEO009	3.88	Everything is on Tophat, slides, hw, etc. Basically AP Environmental Science in HS, but only the ocean parts. Pretty steep learning curve after the first midterm.	6	10/30/2019
		Kind of an easy class, if you focus during lectures. Take it with Professor Brounce if possible. There are two midterms, but she'll drop the worse grade of the two if you bomb either of them. Homework is super easy, and you don't really need the textbook at all because she uploads all of her powerpoints to Top Hat. She can be pretty helpful during office hours, too. 	4	12/14/2019
		It wasn’t that rough. I took it with Maryjo Brounce. My first midterm I got a 68% (the average score) w no curve because I didn’t really take the class seriously. Studied for the next midterm and final and ended up getting an A in the class. She only takes one midterm (the highest one). It’s ust a lot of memorization and information, but not difficult to understand. 	4	12/20/2019
		took it with Brounce. If you can memorize everything on the recap slides it guarantees a b high b ish. Its easy to get an A if you can memorize just the recap+ weird nitty gritty stuff	2	2/26/2020
		Oceanography with MaryJo Brounce wasn't too bad. The material isn't difficult to understand, but there can be a lot of material to memorize if you aren't keeping up. There's quizzes every friday during discussion and she checks attendance during lecture via TopHat questions, but they're extremely easy. She assigns homework but the homework is super simple too. I got an A in the class.	4	3/4/2020
		Took it with Gordon Love, everything is based on slides and open note, no need to go to lectures. The content was heavy though, with around 50 slides for every lecture.	5	12/14/2020
		FALL 2020: Had Gordon Love. Not mandatory to attend lecture but his poll questions that he does during his lectures help sometimes for quizzes and tests. Poll questions aren't counted towards anything; he just does it to help you. There were quizzes every week in your discussion sections on the previous week's material. All quizzes and exams were open note. Straightforward questions. Just make sure to know your stuff and stay on top of the material. Even though the class is open note, it takes a lot of time to search through the slides for the answers since his slides are quite heavy for every chapter/lecture. He drops your lowest 2 quiz scores and takes your best midterm score out of the 2. Final was cumulative and formatted like the quizzes and midterms. Overall, pretty easy class and material isn't that hard to understand. 	3	1/4/2021
		Had this class with Gordon Love. Extremely straightforward class with tests based on lecture slides. Tests were open notes so control F is your best friend and pretty much all you need in this class.	3	5/22/2021
GEO011	5.25	Professor Wei Liu explains the material pretty well, GEO011 is comparable to GEO009 if you've taken that before. Tests were open notes and control F is pretty much the only thing you need. However as a warning, Professor Liu has a pretty strong accent so if you have a lot of trouble with accents you may need more assistance.	3	5/22/2021
		took online with professor allen, he's a little boring but his lectures are basically the textbook. 2 multiple choice exams, lowest score is dropped. first exam was very hard but after feedback from students he made it a bit easier.	7	5/28/2021
		The material is pretty difficult and the exams are hard. Not anywhere as easy as I thought it would be. 	7	8/3/2021
		Professor Allen was super chill and posted both lecture slides AND recordings on Canvas. Attendance was taken through pollevs, and you only had to get 50% correct in order to receive credit. He gave us the choice between online, open-note exams vs. in-person, closed-note exams and we all chose online. All 3 exams were also multiple choice and I got A's on all of them just by ctrl+f-ing my lecture notes & occasionally the textbook (which has a free PDF available), and I didn't have to actually study for any of the exams. Only downside was that his voice was incredibly soothing and easy to fall asleep to, but overall he's a really knowledgeable and easygoing guy!	4	6/7/2023
GEO012	7.00	Tests not curved	7	3/26/2017
GEO013	6.00	Took this with Prof Schweiterman. It was an okay class. Since this was about the solar system I thought it would be easy but there’s a lot of information to retain. Take it if you like science and physics. First test was hard and I think he realized that cuz the second midterm and final were easier. Not the easiest breadth course out there but not the hardest either. Need to put in a bit of work to get an A. Weekly reading quizzes through Smartwork which means you need to buy the textbook online. Also weekly discussion sections. Lowest quiz was dropped. Exams curved. 	6	3/19/2021
GER045	3.00	German film class but everything is in English. Very few class requirements, nice movies, and the professor is super nice!	3	4/6/2020
GRK001	7.00	Professor King is my hero. I'm not a classic major but decided to take Ancient Greek as my foreign language, and only because he's such a cool professor. The class is very organized, and if you're willing to put in the work of doing all the assignments and going to class you'll do well. Definitely not an easy class per-say, but King makes it interesting and goes out of his way to help you succeed, plus he gives you lots of feedback so you can do corrections. 	7	12/1/2020
GSST001	5.00	Ariane Dalla Dea is a mess. She is a poor lecturer. She also has a bad attitude and doesn't like being confronted. The class is worth a total of 100 points and it leaves little to no space for error. If it weren't for our TAs fighting for us, we would all have gotten lower grades. 	4	12/19/2017
		prof ho is very disorganized across online and in person classes	7	9/4/2020
		Super easy class just pay attention and you'll be fine. There are 2 out of 3 essays you have to write so I would recommend writing the first 2 to avoid the last one just for the sake of burnout. Grading is pretty straightforward and most people pass with an A or B	4	9/10/2020
GSST01S	2.86	Every other day is movie day, assigns 2 essays which are easy, teacher is very boring but she takes attendance in lecture	4	11/29/2017
		Easy breadth class, but the material is boring and Guenther does not post her slides online. The weekly assigned readings total around 40-50 pages consisting of several articles. The professor is very biased and shows favoritism in class.	3	6/2/2019
		Professor Riley amazing professor the grade is one movie analysis paper discussion points small quizzes in class and the final very easy basic vocab. Easy A. 	1	5/26/2020
		Professor Guenther’s lectures were amazing. The class had weekly open book iLearn quizzes & piazza posts as well as 2 papers throughout the quarter. To do well in the class make sure to read the material max 20 pages weekly. 	3	6/8/2020
		Professor Riley was an extremely engaging lecturer, which is important when over zoom. She was very attentive to the chat, and encouraged participation and interaction with the material presented in the lectures. Reading assignments can be dense and difficult, but the TAs will help! 	4	3/3/2021
		Prof Guenther gave a lot of material each week but most of it was really interesting. We were assigned 3 papers but got to choose 2 of the 3 to complete. If you are interested in the subject then it is great but there is a lot of reading. 	4	2/23/2022
		"Winter 2023 all online with Prof. Juliann Allison. Asynchronous. This class was really easy. Weekly discussion board assignments that you can get done real quick. However, the instructions and syllabus for this class are extremely vague. There is a midterm and final. The midterm is a 30 question multiple choice test with T/F questions. But the questions are extremely vague. However, it is open note. No textbooks. Justen was my TA and he wasn't the best. Anytime I would ask him a question he was always like ""ask the professor"". It seemed like he did not know the guidelines to this class. "	1	3/8/2023
GSST013S	6.00	Took it with Prof Guenter Fall 2020. It was taught asynchronously, with 2-3 hour long recorded lectures. Easy participation points available, a learning worksheet due every week, and 3 opportunities to write 2 papers. (2 papers required, 3 prompts with flexible timing). No final! Reading/Viewing material was sometimes a lot. Highly recommend nonetheless for a very unique lower division course. 	6	3/3/2021
GSST016	3.00	Wilcox was an amazing professor. This class is new so I recommend going to her office hours for help/to discuss. Not that hard though, but make sure you at least skim the readings. There's no tests, just 2 essays for midterms and one final document of short answers/a really short essay. And TAKE NOTES. Slides are uploaded so they're easy to make up if you miss, but either way make sure you take good notes.	4	3/27/2019
		READ. READ READ READ. 	2	3/27/2019
GSST021	2.50	If you take it with Professor Allison, just pay attention during lecture and go to discussion. If you go to lecture 85% of the time you get extra credit, but if you don't you lose points. You don't have to do the readings. Only read the ones that are mentioned during lecture. Also on exams she gives multiple questions and you can pick and choose the ones you want to answer. 	4	12/11/2019
		Fall 2021. Professor Sasser's asynchronous class. The TA does most of the grading, very rarely I would actually hear from the professor. She just does the lecture videos. There are weekly quizzes, one pagers, and a final group project which sucks. I got stuck with procrastinators. No textbooks for this class. Pretty easy but the final project is your choice. I just don't think asynchronous classes should have group projects. Join the group me for this class. 	1	11/22/2021
GSST137	3.00	Had Addison Davidove they were great with lecture and made class very interesting by having us doing discussion with one another ! Class consist of participation, midterm project on the lecture material, final reflection, and 5 page double space essay also on the course material ! Homework is only made to watch a video and read depending on the week! 	3	3/23/2023
GSST145	1.00	Took it with Professor Allison, it was very straightforward- lots of readings and weekly discussion posts. There's an analytical essay (2-3 pages), final group project, project essay and no midterm/final exams. If you go to 85% of meetings you get full point for participation.	1	6/15/2022
GSST185	5.00	Took this class with Prof Womack. A good lecturer and made class interesting (Attendance mandatory btw). My only issue was her grading with papers and the final, which was 4 essay questions. She is tough, which I am sure is great for majors that need to write a lot, but I was taking this course as Depth. She was not a fan of my writing to say the least. If you are looking to take this class for a Breadth/Depth requirement, don't. You will find easier A's somewhere else.	5	6/12/2022
HASS001	1.00	Super easy class. Mostly is just a class to help ease you into the recources available on campus and help you set up goals you want to acheive while at UCR. There are short essay assignments, but they are all opinion essays that you can BS in an hour or two. 	1	3/25/2021
HISA117A	3.00	Boring with McGarry, but easy class overall. A paper, midterm and final.	3	6/7/2020
HISA117B	10.00	Brian Lloyd taught the class and the entire grade was 50% midterm and 50% final, each test is 10% multiple choice on the reading, 10% multiple choice on lecture, and 80% essay that is turned in on test day 5 pages. His grading is very difficult and no rubric is ever given. Extremely monotone and enters tangents frequently. Asked my friends after the class was over what they got and highest grade was a B. Would not take the professor again.	10	7/18/2019
HISA119	3.50	Took this class with Professor Gudis and it was a breeze. She has readings every week that are time consuming, but super interesting. She is incredibly flexible and understanding, so if you have trouble just reach out. We had weekly quizzes, a midterm essay and a final essay. They all had due dates, but you would not be penalized for being late. That being said, you really have to discipline yourself because otherwise it all piles up at the end and is overwhelming. Overall though, easy class and really enjoyable if you stay engaged. Gudis also helped me to get my internship, so she's a really cool person to make a connection with.	4	2/16/2021
		This was such a fun class! I took with Gudis, she's so awesome. The material is genuinely so interesting, and this is coming from a non-history major. 	3	12/16/2021
HISA162	4.00	3 required essays about 3-4 pages long and a final. Fair amount of reading but easy to do. Brennan is a must have professor at UCR.	4	6/7/2020
HISA165	5.00	Brennan is a stickler for attendance. Easy class with only 3-4 papers based on prompts he gives you. 	5	6/7/2020
HISE146	1.00	If you have Lehmann you are super lucky, he is a really nice. Lecture and readings are MANDATORY. Don't read them or go to lecture you will fail. His quizzes are straight big concepts from the readings and from his slides. If you go to class and do the readings its impossible to fail. Easy A	1	11/18/2019
HISE176	9.00	You actually have to buy 7 books and read them all no midterm just a final and a 7 page essay and participation was 30% of your grade. I took it with Michels	9	3/17/2020
HIST010	4.60	Chrissanthos: Great lecturer, story format, no slides, so take your notes on a laptop. 2 MTs (short answer/fill in blank Q's from lecture and Q's from TA) 1 Final (cumulative, short essays) 1 Term Research Paper on topic of choice. TA/discussion matters! Some TAs grade hard on exams and easy on paper, and vice versa.	3	4/5/2017
		had chrissanthos, if you have a nice TA you’ll be fine, but make sure to study for the midterms and finals! a lot of memorization	7	3/31/2018
		Chrissanthos, story type lecture that is interesting. Two midterms, final, term paper, and discussion material. Get Engin the TA super nice and not too much work. Just pay attention in class. 	3	3/7/2019
		Class was easy, overall. There were some aspects on the second midterm that you had to read from the textbook (first midterm didn't really rely on the textbook) but other than that, tests are fair. Really depends who your TA is as they will be the ones grading everything in this class. Also, don't really depend on writing your notes if you have Chrissanthos. His lectures are more story-telling and he doesn't upload his notes.	4	6/15/2019
		One essay the entire course. The midterms and final were pure memorization. Easy stuff.	2	6/16/2019
		"No lecture slides, just pictures and a general outline of the lecture for the day. It's easier to take notes on a laptop if you're a fast typer. He'll talk out loud in a storyteller fashion and you half to copy down every single thing he says. Unless you want to read the ""required readings"" that aren't really necessary to get an A. "	2	10/30/2019
		Chill class. Had Professor Chrisanthos, who just told history like it was a story. I just took notes on my laptop, kinda like a transcript and highlighted things he emphasized. Exams were fill in the blank and free response. There’s no test bank so I’d get the list of term down as best as I could. I wish I didn’t read the main textbook as much and read the YJC more. TA’s make the quizzes so it’s really up to who you have. No hw, just a term paper on any topic within the time frame of the class. 	4	5/8/2020
		Video lectures were easy to understand. Midterm, Paper, and Final. Midterm was fill in the blank and short answer, and the the final was 5, 1 page essays. 	4	9/4/2020
		There was a five page research paper and a test that consisted of writing 5 one page essays in 3 1/2 hours. There’s no small assignments, so the only things that count towards your grade are the research paper, two tests, and the final. If you’re not a great test-taker, this is a very difficult class.	8	12/28/2020
		Definitely don't take for breadth req, although Chrissanthos knows what he's talking about. His lectures are kind of aggravating since he doesn't have slides and just kind of storytells the lectures. The TA you get really determines your grade for this course, and if you get Richard he's super nice. Two midterms (long answer & short answer), one term paper, and one essay final. Lots of memorization, and you'll definitely need the textbooks for this class. Not hard, but not an easy A either.	7	3/17/2021
		Chrissanthos is a lovely professor but if the format of the class is not to your particular learning type( he will post a lecture video with an outline) it's probably better to take HIST020 because it is much better formatted to online classes(exams are fill in the blank and short answer and no one likes free response for some reason). If possible take John as your TA, he's not only a great teacher but his questions are very fair and similar to Chrissanthos. You can get away with just reading the book and can get a C but getting an A watching lectures does actually help! do have to read the various primary source parts of the textbook but it is not too hard to do outside of class.	1	3/23/2021
		I took this course with Professor Chrissanthos online. He had asynchronous lectures twice a week, which were only around 30-50 minutes each. They were pretty interesting, but he doesn't have any slides so it can be hard figuring out how to spell the names of cities or people from that time period. The grade is made up of your discussion section, two midterms, one term paper, and one final. The midterms were okay, but only because of the way they were graded. It's basically 10ish questions from the professor, which are either fill in the blank or ask you to write five bullet points in response. Then, there are a few questions from your TA. Honestly, some of the questions had nothing to do with what we learned in the lectures, but the TA seemed to grade easy so it was okay.. Next, as for the term paper, its 5-7 pages and you can't really use sources from the internet (history.com, etc), which is a little difficult. Overall, the class is okay, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it unless you're super interested in the time period.	4	11/19/2021
		Not an easy A, you actually have to watch the lectures and read the book.. sigh	7	12/23/2021
		I took this course with Stefan Chrissanthos in the Winter of 2022. While this course wasn’t too difficult, there was a lot of work. In total, there are 2 midterms, 1 cumulative final, and a term paper. While the midterms/final were open notes, there is almost no extra time during the exam to look at them. A lot of students were not able to finish the exams in time. However, if you have a good TA that grades easy, you’ll be just fine. If you’re taking this as a Breadth course, I suggest you take another history course. I finished the class with an A+. 	5	3/22/2022
		Love Professor Chrissanthos. His lectures are really fun and he does it in story format. Make sure you go to lecture!!!! He does not post lecture notes or slides so you have to go (or at least have a friend who can help you out). If you go to lecture and do a little bit of studying before the midterm and final you'll be fine. Midterm is free response format and the final is essay format but both were relatively easy...straight from the lectures.	1	6/18/2022
		Chrissanthos - lectures are interesting but the exams are hard 	8	12/2/2022
		I had Chrissanthos for Spring 2023 and it was actually so much work. There's so much to memorize and he does not post any notes or slides; he kind of just talks slowly during lecture so you have time to write everything down. This class is also extremely exam heavy so make sure you study. There's 2 midterms & our final is 3 one-page essays that we only have an hour & 20 mins to complete. We are also assigned a 5-7 page term paper. Also TAs matter!!!! I got lucky and had Carlos & he was super lenient with the grading but I heard other TA's grade harsher.	6	6/7/2023
HIST010H	6.00	Graninger - 75% of your grade is your exams (there are 2 1-week long midterms & a final). Final was easy--especially if you looked at his study guide since his study guide is literally the final! But the midterms can be a little difficult depending on your TA. The other 25% is participation in discussion and these points are rewarded based on your TA... I felt like the class wasn't structured very well and the grades were kind of arbitrary but it might be because it's the first time that he taught this specific honors class?	8	6/16/2019
		I took this class with Dr Randy Head online and he made the class very easy and fun to follow. Essay prompts were easy enough and my TA (Jordan if you're reading this thank you!) helped a lot during office hours to help develop my ideas. I'm not a history major so I was pretty worried going into this class but honestly the professor and the TAs alleviated a lot of my concerns.	4	7/21/2020
HIST015	5.50	Took this class with Prof Eacott.  Grading is largely determined by how picky your TA is with your essays/midterms.  Please keep in mind there are multiple essays and many assigned readings for this class.  It isn't extremely difficult but not a cakewalk either.	7	3/30/2017
		Take Patch if possible. He's a very fun lecturer and his TAs aren't ridiculously difficult graders. If you put in a decent amount of effort, you'll get an A. 	1	3/31/2017
		Took with Professor Patch; he was a really friendly guy that had a very enjoyable lecture style & demeanor which made the class easy to absorb. It's not a hard class, just a lot of writing. Your assignments & exams will consist solely of essays.	4	6/28/2017
		Lots of reading, two assignments (fairly easy), both midterm and final were in class essays. Professor doesn't upload PowerPoints on iLearn so make sure to go to lecture.	6	3/29/2018
		For Eacott, make sure you do the readings and attend lecture. There was a lot of readings, but manageable if you do them regularly.The final consists of short responses and two essay questions. The class was interesting, but my TA graded pretty intensely.	7	3/18/2019
		Professor Eacott made the lectures really engaging, and does not post the slides online, but going to lectures anyways helps a lot because he gives verbal hints on what's on the midterm/final. There is 3/4 books you need and weekly readings, but it's manageable if you can schedule everything. I procrastinated all readings til finals week, and I passed but with a C, so this class isnt the hardest but if you put in effort it can be fairly easy. Also, your TA plays a large role on your grade because they are the ones that grade your paper. Go to office hours and show you care about passing, and undoubtably it will boost your grade.	4	4/3/2019
		Hughes won't put slides online and themes the class in a kind of odd way but isn't bad as a professor. No tests, just in-class essays. Reading-heavy but you don't have to read everything in full. Almost everything is really based on opinion, you can take a little bit of historical fact and as long as it seems thoughtful and you justify it, you can say any bullshit you want.	5	6/11/2019
		Jennifer Hughes...2 midterms (2 in class essay each exam)....Take home final. Please don’t take this woman. She’s only here to boost her ego. 	9	6/15/2019
		professor hughes = a lot of reading! the class is made up of 3 midterms and 1 final, no tests, all essays based on the readings in class. 2 in-class essays, the last 2 are online. she puts up the lecture slides online, but she doesn't put up all of the slides (ie. you have to go to class to see some key facts/slides), she also gives you potential essay questions in-class and she'll choose one for your midterm. not the hardest class to take, but it will require a lot more effort	7	12/7/2019
		Took it with Prof Hughes, she treats the class like a W class; the midterms and final are all essays. There are 3 midterms on books and articles that you have to read; she doesn’t talk about them in class or give you enough supporting evidence during lecture. She didn’t really know what she was teaching. Half the class was either asleep or just didn’t come to lecture. Discussion’s really important, talk to your TA’s and go to office hours because they’re the one’s grading the essays. Class is easy but she’s difficult.  	6	12/17/2019
		had Hughes for lecture, gives 3 midterms and 1 final, all essays. each midterm is based on a book she has you read and it's very boring if you don't like history. If you get a ta who is an easy grader you'll be fine with a decent amount of effort. try not to fall behind on readings as the midterms and final are based on what you read. 	6	2/7/2020
		Took with Patch. Class consists of one essay (based on readings), a midterm (IDs and an essay), a final (IDs and 2 essays, one based on the entire course and another based on 2nd half of course). There's a geography quiz in discussion towards the beginning of quarter. Lecture was pretty fun, but the notes he posts on iLearn are pretty vague so you have to pay attention in class. He doesn't have slides, just kinda rambles on about history. Discussion sections and mandatory and you need to do the readings to participate. THERE IS SO MUCH READING IN THIS CLASS. There's 3 assigned books, weekly assigned readings on iLearn, and weekly assigned readings from the textbook. You will be reading every single week. If you get behind it's hard to catch back up.	8	3/9/2020
		Robert Patch explains everything you need in lecture, so go to his lectures and record them. His outlines are good, but all the details are in the lectures. Lots of readings and essay due at the end of the quarter. Prepare for essays for the midterm and final as well	5	3/19/2020
		Attending lecture is only necessary for the first half up til the midterm for Patch. Afterwards I just used my notes from discussion. My TA (Emily) was great though idk how useful the other TAs are. It's useful to make a document of all the readings and a summary of them. In general though look for patterns in the history, he'll point some out too. 	5	3/27/2020
		It's not a hard class but god, it is a lot of reading. I took it with Professor Robert Patch and I did not learn anything. His class is really disorganized, so try to get a good TA. The reading was basically 100+ pages a week. This class is not for lazy people. But I got a B in the class without managing to do any of the readings. The tests are not multiple choice so they are purely essay based. It is do-able, but stressful. Honestly I would take HIST010 if I were you because this class requires you to spend a lot of $$$ on books 	5	5/7/2020
		[COVID-19 ERA: SPRING 2020] Took this class with Eacott. I was honestly dreading this class because this was the only lower-div class I had to take with my other upper-div classes, but Eacott made this class really interesting. He was also VERY understanding because of COVID-19 and the entire quarter being online. No exams; just two papers, lots of readings (which I will admit I forgot to do a lot of lol) and a big final project (in groups). Papers can be hard depending on how picky your TA is. If your TA is Clayton, then you're good to go, he's a super chill TA. The second paper was made optional and we got an extension on the final project due to #BLM. Highly recommend Eacott. Class isn't difficult, but definitely don't forget about this class either. Also, Eacott is very handsome :)	4	6/23/2020
		Take with prof downs if you can! During Winter 2021, just weekly readings and listening ti podcasts. No midterms or finals, just a book review final which was 6-8 pages	3	3/16/2021
		Don't take this with Eacott. He's very charismatic but this class was unnecessarily difficult for an intro level History class. Lots of required readings. If you're interested in the subject I say go for it because Eacott was pretty cool but otherwise look for an easier option.	7	5/22/2021
		Took it Winter '22 with Prof. Jennifer Hughes. The class itself was not all that difficult, it was actually the first time I found a history class somewhat interesting. You read 3 books (I did more skimming than reading tho and was fine), and you write an essay about each book. The hardest part about this class was having to deal with the prof. She would post everything late, assign things Fri or Sat night and make it due 8am Mon, and literally banned technology from the class (meaning we had to take handwritten notes & actually buy the books). Lectures were absolutely useless, but are still required. Everything you need to know will be learned in discussion.	5	3/31/2022
HIST017A	4.00	I had Dr. Albert Dorsey, a guest lecturer and he's chill and kind. Midterm was a couple of multiple choice questions, fill in the blank, and 3 short essays. I think how you do in the class depends on the TA since they grade everything. Homework is just reading chapters in the textbook. One actual assignment is an analysis of a book. Your grade is made up of 25% of attendance to discussion, 25% midterm, 25% final, 25% book review. 	4	11/21/2019
HIST017B	4.50	I have professor Nicolette Rohr. She is a good professor. You need to be in class at all times because it is an oral class with absolutely no text book. She never repeats anything. You can't take pictures or videos of lectures. The slides are not posted. I got an A- on the essay and the midterm. Honestly I had one of the highest grades on both. It's harder than it should be for a breadth, but it's not bad. Discussion is really chill but mandatory. She gives a study guide with what will be on the test (exact questions)-she picks from them but they are all written tests. 2 essays, 1 midterm, 1 final + discussion.	6	2/28/2020
		Professor Hawkins is one of the BEST professors at UCR. I was never much of a history fan but the way he lectures feels like he is reading you a story, it's so engaging! 2 Midterms, both essay questions, which are really simple since the answers are in his lectures. One 4-5 page paper, which was really easy as well. Laid back class, no traditional tests, & took it asynchronously.	3	6/11/2021
HIST020	3.89	Lots of reading and essays. Midterm/finals were short answer/essay questions.	7	3/28/2017
		I barely went to lecture (about half before midterm, twice after) and I got out with an A-.	2	12/22/2017
		Do the readings, David Biggs’ lectures are a mess but go anyway, papers were graded really lax but actually put some effort in and you’ll do great	7	3/27/2018
		dont take this class this professor assigns 30 pages per lecture reading.. insane and has a super strict TA that grades like crazy i did all of the readings and he gave me a F. im super pissed rn and waiting for my response why i got this grade. 	9	3/27/2019
		Be careful with the TA you pick. I had Prof. Hawkins and TA David Shanta and he was much more tedious when it came to grading. Go to office hours with your TA to figure out what they want since they grade everything (1 midterm 1 final 1 paper) very interesting material and loved the assigned readings! Best history class to choose in my opinion. Hawkins had a young spirit and kept us interested especially with his jokes	7	12/6/2019
		Professor Juliette Levy's class is SO easy. There's NO EXAMS, only small writing assignments. The lectures are asynchronous and are in the forms of short podcasts (that she provides transcripts for). I hate history but this class is actually really fun I'd definitely recommend. Also a lot of extra credit.	1	2/2/2021
		Took it with Hawkins, he's a really nice professor! Your grade is composed of 2 midterms, a final, and discussion section. Each midterm is 2 long essay questions, and the final is based off the books you read in class, not lecture material. Took it online: asynchronous lecture, synchronous discussion. I feel like your grade depends on your TA since they do the grading and some might be more strict with their grading than others. 	6	3/19/2021
		(Taken online during Winter 2021) This is probably the easiest history course you can take since there are no exams. There are only quizzes that are extra credit, which can boost your grade up to 10%. There's also short weekly podcasts that you have to write comments for, but are graded on completion. Most of your grade depends on the decade assignments, which are short 400+ word essays. The prompts were sometimes confusing, but it didn't take up that much of my time to write. There were 4 of these assignments and it is graded by your TA, so you grade kinda depends on how nice they are and if you basically follow the rubric, it shouldn't be too hard to do well on these essays. Apparently, there was supposed to be one decade assignment per week (pre-COVID), but she changed to biweekly assignments to make it easier for students in the pandemic. She also made the final optional for us. It was a relatively easy A class for most people as long as you complete all the assignments, come to discussion, and do all the extra credit quizzes.	3	3/22/2021
		Took with Professor Levy. Instead of lectures, she posts podcasts with transcripts and has u listen to those. They mostly assign busy work and there's A LOT of extra credit. There's one final paper in the end but u pretty much work on it throughout the quarter. For grades, u either get a check or no check for the assignments. It depends on how closely u follow the prompts and if u did what they were looking for	2	12/9/2021
		2021 online fall. Dr. Levy is nice, 10 points of EC!!! No tests at all. The extra credits are merely quizzes but easy contents (you can google for the answer). I get 50% on my final project but still have a A(95) on the overall grade. 	4	12/13/2021
		Asynchronous with podcast as lecture, long assignment every other week leads up to the big essay for the final , you either get full points or 0 so as long as you put in some effort into your work, you'll pass with an A.	5	12/14/2021
		Super easy class with Juliette Levy, the TA Betul was a picky grader which was annoying, but the class was easy extra credit was available (can boost up to one full grade) you would listen to weekly podcast and do a little review on it and every two weeks there was a writing assignment pretty easy class	3	12/17/2021
		Took it with Professor Biggs. He's chill and passionate on 20th-century World History,  but his readings (all pdfs) and lectures are hugely overloaded. Participation does matter for discussion sections and also recommended for attending lectures as well. 1 Paper, 1 midterm, 1 family project (paper & artwork), and 1 final are heavily based on the readings, lectures, and historic movies (one of them is Godzilla). All of them are graded by TAs, so your grades depend on how well you know and relate to the reading materials and the professor's themes for 20th-century World History. You have to keep track with the syllabus for vocabs and specific reading questions for each week if you truly want to understand and ace this course. Take this course if you're comfortable related to or you know more about 20th-Century World History than other history courses. 	5	3/6/2022
		Took with Leal. Two quizzes with a week to do each. The short essay was graded relatively easily.	3	3/27/2022
		Fall 2022 with Levy. Really nice prof, no scheduled lectures just three podcasts to listen to weekly. Lecture comments are extremely easy, 10% extra credit thats really easy to earn, research assignments were a pain but wasn't that bad, we got the option to opt out of the final due to the strike so the class wasn't bad. Prob a 5 difficulty if I had to do the final	3	12/9/2022
		Winter 2023 all online with Prof. Downs. Super easy class. Weekly podcasts and short responses every week. Two essays based off two books that you choose. Lynda was my TA she is super nice, a fair grader, and very helpful when going to office hours and emails. I learned so much from this class and it was not boring at all. 	1	3/8/2023
		Jordan Downs is AMAZING. Instead of lectures, he does weekly podcasts that are entertaining and easy to digest. The 2 term papers are pretty easy and the TAs are super helpful. 	1	6/1/2023
		Just take the online version 	1	6/9/2023
HIST020V	3.00	Lectures delivered in form of podcasts, one 10-question quiz each week (multiple choice, easy), one written assignment - includes research, final project (a paper) in place of final.	3	3/26/2017
HIST020W	6.25	"first 2 essays are pretty easy, final prompt was a nightmare
Dana Simmons is a good lecturer"	7	12/15/2018
		I think we had around three essays, a midterm, and a final exam. I took this class in the Spring Quarter and had Professor Tomoff. Seemed like a good guy but his lectures were meh, so I ended up going to class around 4-5 times total (UV theater didn't help at all). Regardless, there's a lot of reading that goes into the class that you SHOULD do, and the discussions are pretty good. Good luck with the essays, as the TA's are really stingy with the stuff you write. 	7	7/15/2019
		DO NOT TAKE! If you can take English 1C. The essays are a nightmare. You do not really understand what heck you are writing about. You have to go to workshops that only help you with your structure and not the essay itself. The prof. will not help just tell you what guidelines are and move on. Your TA will only help you to a certain point and not really explain to you exactly what you need help on. 	8	10/26/2019
		I took it with Dana Simmons. She's a very knowledgeable professor who clearly knows her stuff. She does a great job in lecture and truly cares about the students and is super approachable. The TAs are generally knowledgeable and do what they can to help. One midterm and one final that are both just ID terms (choose 5 of 7 she gives you). Three essays, they can be kinda tricky. Required writing workshops. Get ready to read a whole bunch and spend a lot of time outside of class. 	6	11/18/2019
		really easy!! about three essays and theyre phrased weird but theyre very easy prompts. the in class midterm though is very simple its define 5 terms and give an example. Simmons is cool to!! david is the best TA	5	11/19/2019
		Had Professor Tomoff, it's fairly easy material to digest but you particularly get stuck during essays. For Spring2020 online classes, he uploaded lectures to a google drive, three each week. You also have about 3 readings for each lecture, I suggest you not to read all and consult the Midterm/Final and Paper prompts that are uploaded early to know what to actually read. There are 3 essays, midterm and final. Midterm and final exam are the same format, he gives you 3-6 prompts and he chooses which one you'll have to complete. For the midterm, he gave us about 24 hours to complete and upload to iLearn whereas, for the Final, he'll give you 36 hours to complete and upload. The essay prompts are broad and hard to grasp at times so I suggest you attend a workshop to better understand it, my TA was also broad on what he expected so it made it worst. No memorization needed for anything since everything is open book/notes!	7	5/27/2020
HIST030	4.00	Took it with Professor Samuel Fullerton on Henry the 8th and his wives during Winter '23 . The professor was chill and laid back but pretty lecture heavy in terms having to be very attentive to listening carefully since his slideshows does not cover any bullet points and homework assignments were just to read ! The class is based on 3 essays that are based from the homework reading assignments and a fun part of the class was watching a performance video from Six the Musical and watching the 1st episode of Showtime's The Tudors ! Also as a piece of advice do carefully proofread essay since he does grade them slightly strict . 	4	3/23/2023
HIST036	4.00	Professor Trafzer is a really passionate dude that loves his history. He makes the class interesting and always tells stories about his experiences with Native Americans. The overall class is really interesting and taught well. TA Amanda is super helpful for preparing for essays and exams. All the exams are open book, so make sure to take good notes. There's two essays on readings, but honestly I read 10 pages of both the books and I got an A on both papers. This is a really good class if you need an easy A, just be prepared to take notes because Trafzer's slides aren't very detailed	4	2/11/2020
HIST039	3.00	Asian American History with Prof. Asaka (Fall 2020). She’s really cool and makes the class easy. Weekly mandatory discussions but asynchronous lectures. It’s really really interesting but make sure you read the readings before the lecture if you want to get the participation points and talk. Skimming over them works too but know the general idea. Weekly discussion posts based on the readings due the night before your discussion,  but you only have to do 5/10 and a final paper. 	3	12/28/2020
HIST044	See RLST044			
HIST089	5.00	History of Cartography - the entire class is reading and writing but the writing assignments aren't hard. The required book is pretty cheap, $20, and the rest of the readings are online. The course load for the readings can be a lot sometimes. The writing assignments are summary and analysis and the professor is willing to read drafts and help before the due date. She drops the lowest score for the five writing assignments. As long as you go to the class and keep up with the writing assignments, its really easy. 	5	4/2/2021
HIST099W	3.00	Super easy class for history majors, just keep up with the work, and it is an easy A. Most local libraries have the World War Z book online so just make an account to access it. 	2	12/4/2018
		It's a mandatory workshop for History majors. Take Professor Levy online. Easy assignments even if they're tedious. Easy A.	4	6/7/2020
HIST104	2.00			
HIST107	3.00	Took the class Fall 2020. Online. Professor Lentacker was very reasonable. Instead of meeting our scheduled times, he separated the class into 4 discussion sections where we meet only once a week. No exams but there was a final paper and other writing assignments throughout the quarter.	5	12/28/2020
		taken with Hackel Summer 2022, who would refuse to record any lectures due to his inexperience with technology, but overall the course was very easy-- pay semi-attention to class, his slides are mainly pictures and he goes pretty fast when he talks and there is a final about lectures (all multiple choice, and the answers are pretty obvious if you pay a little attention to class and take notes). there are also 2 readings that I literally just found reviews for and wrote the short essays based on the reviews and got 95+ scores; you don't even need to read the entire book to achieve an A overall in the class. there are also sometimes some in-class writing activities you would complete for points since participation is not graded and class is not recorded	1	4/10/2023
HIST108	2.92	Pretty easy, almost always gives out A+ for minimal effort, 3 multiple choice tests are open everything	3	12/22/2020
		Ramps up in difficulty towards the end, papers are a joke but I have no idea how they grade the papers (fall 2020) so just do the 1 reading a week	5	1/2/2021
		Very easy upper division breadth course. Took in fall 2020 with Tofigh. 3 multiple choice tests, 2 essays plus a final essay	2	2/23/2021
		Class grade was based on three multiple choice tests and two essays. As long as you read the required readings and went to lecture it was pretty easy to get an A.	3	3/19/2021
		Took with Tofigh. People complaining are probably because they don't follow his essay instructions. If you want to ace his essays, literally open a google doc and just spill all your knowledge on the subject that comes DIRECTLY from the reading or the powerpoints. Dont use any fancy stuff or fluff or anything that doesn't come from the reading or powerpoint. Easy A. Study powerpoints for tests, test material comes straight from powerpoint/lecture material	1	3/25/2021
		Got an A- with zero effort, just do well on the multiple choice exams to get an A. The midterm and final are essay-based that focus on mentioning all the key points.  	4	3/29/2021
		Took it with Tofigh Heidarzadeh. He's super passionate about it so I would recommend going to lecture bc he makes it interesting. But even if you skipped all the lectures it's still an easy A. He's the only teacher I've had that said not to cite your sources, he actively told us to not cite your sources. The essay prompts are based on the book anyway so I guess there's no point in citing it since he always know what your source is but I just thought it was funny.	2	11/7/2021
		3 multiple choice tests, midterm and final (all open note btw) are essay based which sounds a little bit scary until you realize that there is no deep analysis at all, you literally just answer content knowledge based questions. Don't use Google for these essays though, get the content straight from the reading and the powerpoints because thats what they look for. Personally I never really showed up to lecture or did the readings and got by really easily with an A just using my resources during the tests since you're allowed to use any material. If you need the extra points Professor Tofigh offers a grade bump with iEval (i think it was 10% extra on the 3rd mc test).	2	12/10/2021
		Professor was Tofigh. No homework for this class, required readings from textbooks that to be honest you don't need to read until the final. 3 tests total which are multiple choice. Only the third one is more difficult. Honestly, don't even need to go to lectures since the powerpoint slides are super helpful. 	3	12/22/2021
		"took the class with a professor with a really complicated name. winter 2022. Not bad at all. only reason to go to class is for pollev. there are assignments total: 1 essay, 1 mcq, midterm(essay), 1mcq, then final(essay and mcq). everything was online and we had to take it with a lockdown browser. very simple and easy class, you dont have to read the ""required readings"" just skim the slides a week before each tests and youll be fine. its all open note so you can download the slides and look at them as you take the tests. only struggle is finding the motivation to go to class so you can do the pollev. "	5	2/23/2023
		Taken with Heidarzadeh Winter 2023, there were PollEv questions at the last 10-15 mins of class that counted towards participation points, which essentially made up 15% of your grade. If you did not show up to the lecture in person, just pull up PollEv on your device and wait for the questions to pop up. The PollEv questions were also what made up a majority of the midterm questions, so knowing the right answers to the questions was important. The essay questions/exams were not difficult nor lengthy, just make sure to address ALL subquestions when writing the essay, and do not go over the word limit. The TAs would be the ones grading the essays, so pray you get a nice TA. Overall, though this class gives you no HW, it was a lot of busy work during exams season, and an easy A.	2	4/10/2023
HIST109	4.80	Extremely easy. The essays are 1 page long, and the written exams require you to write a few paragraphs about the subject.	3	3/28/2018
		Dr. Tofigh Heidarzadeh I thought it was kinda difficult, but then again I'm really bad at history. Everyone else thought it wasn't too bad. Making flashcards to study the definitions are really helpful. One midterm, which is written in blue book, and two tests, which are scantron. Just study the given definitions and clicker questions and it shouldn't be too bad. Final is also bluebook. Two essays on various topics. Make sure to be detailed on the essays, everything is in the textbook or available online so make sure to include the important bits. 	7	6/15/2018
		"I had Professor Tofigh Heidarzadeh. Very good professor/lecturer, very engaging and very friendly. The class has clicker/attendance which are worth 10% of your grade so be warned. The most important thing in this class is understanding KEY WORDS / BUZZ WORDS. In his essay/midterm instructions or even when he reiterates several times in lecture, he will tell you to follow a certain essay format (introduction, 1-2 paragraphs, conclusion, etc) but do not listen to him. The key is memorizing KEY WORDS to do well on the essays/midterm/final. For example, if a prompt asks about energy changes in the industrial revolution, you only need to say ""energy changed from wood, wind, water to iron, coal, steam"" and that's basically 20% of your grade awarded to you. You do not need to be exceptionally formal; this is not an English class."	4	6/19/2018
		"Took it with Tofigh Heidarzadeh. Two essay tests, and two take-home essays. Overall, this class is like any other history class: boring, a lot of memorize, and annoying. The midterm and final; you're expected to memorize more than 10 prompts, and you're basically expected to write paragraphs about those subjects. The subject material in this class is sub-par.
What really makes this class either suck hard or easy-mode are the graders; you can have all the keywords needed for a prompt, and end up with a D on your paper all because you forgot one keyword that wasn't even part of what the prompt was asking you for. If you're looking for an upper-division DEPTH course, don't take this class. It's a trap."	7	3/25/2019
		Honestly don't know why people are complaining about this class, really easy essays and multiple choice tests and everything is open note (might be different when we're back in person though).	3	3/24/2021
HNPG001B	2.00	This is a BS class. GPA booster. 2 essays, 2 presentations, just show up to the discussion.	2	6/14/2018
HNPG002W	5.50	Took this online. Cardullo is the professor who gives the lectures which are very insightful on real world problems and important things about Riverside, so it's more interesting than English classes, but the TA grades everything including essays and participation. Lectures were asynchronous and we had to submit a google form reflection on them which were simple, but discussion with TA met once a week. We had to read 2 books and had discussions on those/lectures each week and also had student led discussions. I struggled in this class because I'm a reserved person and found it hard to participate since a lot of honors students are well-spoken and always have something to say. I also dislike writing essays, so that was a struggle to me too but there were 4 essays of increasing length. I averaged A- on the essays(which was about the class average of each essay) and somehow ended up with an A in the class, so I'm guessing most people get A's in the class or at least half the class does as long as you participate, show up to discussion, and do decent on the essays. If you struggle with writing, they offer lots of help/resources. Don't procrastinate on the essays, so you can get advice/feedback from TAs and other writing helpers. I also never got the score for my participation/last essay, so I'm not sure how they grade those lol, but I didn't participate every time, I only made sure to participate in the student led discussions, but it probably depends how picky your TA is. If you're good with participating in class and don't struggle that much with writing, then this class should not be too bad.	6	12/25/2020
		I believe Professor Cardullo is the only professor to teach this class (I could be wrong). The class was pretty straightforward as long as you kept up with the work. The probably most difficult aspect of this class is participating in the discussions since class participation is part of your grade. So if you're an outspoken person, this class should be really easy but if you are more quiet, you need to push yourself more to speak.	5	5/22/2021
HNPG016	3.67	Dr. Ricky's Punk and Post-Punk Culture seminar was incredible! Most of our time was spent discussing the material, and the professor was amazing at facilitating the discussion and making everyone feel included. The grade is mostly based on participation but there was one midterm and a final project which is your choice (I wrote a paper but some people made 'zines, for example). I had a wonderful time in the class and would definitely recommend it to anyone.	1	12/14/2019
		Had Link Fall 2020 for Literary Response to Natural Disasters. He's a very sweet person, definitely one of the best professors I've ever had. But his class is very very very reading heavy and I spent around 3-5 hours doing the reading for each class. He gives a few questions before each class which you will be going over, which I highly recommend working on beforehand. You have an essay due every week which are pretty easy, and he drops your lowest grade. But I didn't my grade the whole quarter until after the quarter was done which was nerve wracking. You have no tests but there is a final paper which you can ask him to go over, which I highly recommend. 	5	1/31/2021
		This is magic realism, and it is taught by one teacher, Prof Tyler. I know this is one of the newer mandatory honors seminar classes, and it was probably the most stressful classes I've had to take. Prof Tyler liked to rant about off-topic subjects in her mandatory seminars, but that wasn't what made me hate this class. She assigned annotating homework weekly, but never posted it on time and when asked about it, ended up extending the date to weeks after it was originally due. This happens almost every week. She never put in any grades for the annotations, and all that was just mysteriously factored in to our final letter grade at the end of the quarter. (I still don't know what kind of annotations she expected out of us bc she provided literally 0 feedback). The midterm was take-home, and had around 10-11 questions that required paragraph responses with a short essay at the end of the exam. At the end of the quarter, she got rid of the final and instead posted an essay for us to do. She did not provide the promised feedback on everyone's essays until a few days before it was due. If you do end up taking her class, just know that your final grade will be a toss-up, because even if you ask her questions and go to her office hours, the prof will not give you a clear answer about anything. 	5	1/5/2023
	5.00	Attendance is required. Professor Corey was the best professor I have had so far. Do the work and you'll get an A.	5	2/3/2022
ITAL004	7.00	Fairly easy if you are able to memorize vocab and grammar structure. All tests are free response except one section of the final. Essays are required but you have to turn a rough draft before.	7	6/3/2019
ITAL158	2.00	Professor Tinozzi Mehrmand. Spring 22. Easy class. All online. Requires cameras on during lecture. Make sure you participate. Attendance and participation matters. You learn a lot about Italian literature. (no Italian language knowledge is required). Two tests (one midterm one final). Easy if you do all the readings. Make sure to read all of the readings as there is homework for each one (answering simple questions about the reading). No textbook	2	5/23/2022
JPN001	4.00	took it with miura. great professor, and will do his best to explain something if you ask, but can come off as kind of intimidating lmao. tons of quizzes and homework assignments that really do add up, and are pretty simple, so don't slack off. 3 exams, and one oral exam at the end of the quarter. passed with an 89%. don't take this class if you hate cold calling tho	6	3/17/2021
		Took it with professor Sato who is the sweetest professor I've met. She's accommodating and patient, her teaching method is also very kindergarten like because it is an introductory language class so if you're into that style I recommend taking her. She does get a little stricter after the Katakana portion because it is a lot to remember but does genuinely care about the grades of her students and makes the class fun.	2	4/30/2022
JPN023	See CPLT023			
JPN056	7.00	A lot of writing and reading. 2 texts every week and discussions about text for participation points. only 4 assignments excluding final, 2 quiz 2 essay. 2 essay are small but you will have to read the text to get a good score, quizzes are BS and you need to know the smallest details disucsseed during lecture. Otherwise professor is good and helpful but there will be 0 extra credit so your final grade is ur grade. I ended up getting a A- just cuz i was short 1 point he was not willing to give. 	7	12/23/2022
JPN152K	1.00	This class isn't difficult. Rather, the professor is super easy going, and lenient. However, the downside is that the professor is disorganized when it comes to giving assignments/sources for papers/emailing. I recommend this class to people interested in Japanese literature. The topics are sure interesting.	1	12/13/2019
KOR001	2.00	"Took with Professor Hong. Should be generally easy like the rest of the intro to language classes. The quizzes, midterm, and final will be testing you on vocabulary and the conjugations that you learn in class - it really just takes practice and are literally taken from lecture. Make sure you know the spelling! There are vowels that sound the same but are spelled differently - the only way to learn the difference is to remember it. The only ""difficult"" thing might be the group project. We have a choice to do a skit in class or through a video, so a majority did the video. As Korean 1, you only learn the very basic grammatical structures, so the video, if a more fun/creative idea (ex: Kdrama parodies), it requires you to speak in sentences we wouldn't have been able to learn. Using Google translate would probably be okay but it'd be obvious and wouldn't sound too great to the professor. The professor is super lenient with the video so just have fun with it. Filming and editing does take a while so I'd recommend to start early. It's a pretty fun class, would recommend it if you're not sure which language to take."	2	12/14/2019
KOR020B	6.00	I took professor Hong and landed the class after taking a placement exam. I'm Korean American but don't speak it at all at home so I struggled than most of the other kids but she was very accommodating. She did have scary ahjumma energy at times but that's just how she is, the biggest part of the class is spelling and grammar. Vocab occasionally which is the easiest part and a presentation towards the middle of the class. This was all during COVID so it was online and she did require cameras, so I'm not sure about now.	6	4/30/3022
LABR001	3.50	Had Prof. Brookes and the topic revolving labor studies is pretty self explanatory with many background history of how labor studies came to be. Pretty easy if you studied the slides and attended lecture bc there are things Brookes explained in person that aren't on the slides. She also goes over the reading that was hw in class the next day which counted as 10% of your participation grade but your also given an opportunity to participate on canvas if you dont like talking in class. some of the exam questions were fill in the bank with MCs. she does curve the grade if the class average is lower than what she expected. she is pretty chill and laid back overall	5	11/15/2022
		Dr. Brookes was amazing and caring when it comes to understanding the class needs. Exams( Regular and final) mainly focus from readings and lectures through mc/ short answers. Participation matters in class and no separate discussion course.   	2	1/6/2023
LATN001	5.00	Prof C makes learning Latin extremely fun and he genuinely cares about the success of his students. He is easily accessible and responds to messages so fast. The class is easy if you stay on top of memorizing, pay attention in class, and practice the assignments. He grades fairly and offers extra credit. Really fun class and excellent professor. 	5	10/31/2022
LBST001	2.00	I took the class with Stephen James in the Spring of 2022. This was honestly one of the easiest classes I’ve ever taken at UCR. It’s a class that critiques elements of the Liberal Arts education system such as the humanities and social sciences. There are no midterms or finals, just a 6 page paper at the end of the quarter detailing a course schedule for your next few years at UCR. Just turn in your discussion assignments on time and do well on the paper. I ended the class with an A+. 	2	6/15/2022
LING020	5.70	Quizzes are super easy, but weren’t worth a lot. Quiz questions were given ahead of time. Homework is a BIG part of your grade & the TAs grade homework in a very strict manner. Do not use internet sources or peers for your homework or else you’ll be excused if cheating & reported to student conduct (our professor would threaten us every week about this lmao). Exams are fairly easy, study the study guide slides & you’ll do fine. Our prof said she’d curve the grades at the end. But avoid Prof Chidambaram PLZ lol	7	12/18/2017
		Professor is a horrible teacher. Relatively unhelpful TA. If you somehow still want to take this class, do NOT take it with Vrinda Chidarbarm. 	10	12/21/2017
		This class is basically the same as LING021 except 21 is much more focused on grammar; 20 is more broad and easier, in my opinion. If you're someone who's naturally good at English/foreign languages then this is an easy A as long as you take notes during lectures (even if you're a STEM person this class still isn't very hard). I had Dr. Heidi Waltz, she's really sweet and tries her best to keep everyone engaged.	2	6/9/2018
		Buy the book, get Dr. Waltz. Class is pretty simple, every lesson is taken straight from the book!	3	6/15/2018
		I had Heidi Waltz as a professor, would recommend. Just attend lecture, and take notes. She only tests on material that you go over in class. She gives helpful study guides with topics that tests will go over. Just look over the study guide with your notes and you should be good. The final exam was not cumulative and only tested on material learned after the midterm. She gives full credit on homework as long as you attempt it. 	4	12/21/2018
		This class is unnecessarily difficult. The material isn’t even that hard to comprehend but Vrinda Chidambaram is a bad teacher and makes it too complicated. On top of that, homework is graded based on accuracy out of 5 points and it’s worth 40% of your grade. You lose points very easily on homework; the answer may be correct but if it’s not written correctly you will lose points. It’s obvious Chidambaram does not care about her students and their success. In lecture, listen attentively but DO NOT ask a question that’s been asked before. She will yell at you. This class desperately needs discussion sections. Everyone I know is failing. 	8	5/30/2019
		This class was so hard with Professor Chidambaram!! do not take it when you are have a lot on your plate. She made this class wayyyyy too hard than it seems. Thank God I took this class during remote learning. If I took the class in person, I probably would have done credit/no credit or failed. 	8	6/2/2020
		Professor Chidambaram is really difficult. She isn't understanding at all when it comes to technical difficulties. The TAs are doing their best, but because the material Is so difficult and the professor is hard to get in contact with, its not easy. 	8	8/3/2021
		I had Heidi Waltz. All of the homework was online, and my discussion was online. I did not attend lecture like almost ever, just have access to the textbook and you can complete the HW. There were only 3 HW assignments, a midterm, and a final. Everything was online so as long as you collaborate on these assignments you dont need to rlly study. the material is super easy to grasp and self-explanatory as someone who doesnt attend lecture and will skim the textbook occasionally when doing HW. 	1	12/11/2022
		lectures were so boring, but the textbook was very helpful! i took this class fall of 2022 during the teacher strikes which meant that her grading was super annoying and took forever. 	6	3/1/2023
LING021	3.00	I took it with Prof Heidi Waltz to fulfill my additional humanities course, and it was surprisingly an easier class than I thought. Maybe it's because I had prior knowledge in grammar from high school, but the class consists of no discussion and 1 midterm (half is split in a span of two days) + 1 final + HW assignments = your grade. You'll be lost if you don't go to lecture because the textbook doesn't explain things in detail as the professor does. Overall, I learned a lot about linguistics and would recommend taking it because it's an easy concept to follow. Exam questions are literally from the hw/textbook, and Dr. Waltz is really sweet and caring. 	5	3/22/2018
		Grammar. Took it with Heidi Waltz. In person lecture and mandatory discussion attendance. We had 5 hw assignments that were pretty easy and very similar to the stuff she taught us. Midterm and Final were online, open note and everything. They were both very easy too, final had extra credit points on it. If you're an international students that learned grammar in school, this class should be very easy to you.	1	3/17/2022

LNST001	2.00	the prof, jorge montesinos, was very into the material and gives u  chances to redeem ur grade via extra credit assignments after the midterm. 2 exams which were just a takehome midterm and takehome final which were graded pretty easy. he doesnt post lecture notes so going to lecture is a must and ur grade is basically just the exams but he curves slightly dependuing on class avg	2	3/4/2020
LWSO100	4.00	I took this class twice, one in Fall 2021 and the other Summer 2022. First time taking it, the class was taught by Cranor virtually and he does talk a lot but overall did learn a lot. Attendance was 10% of our grade, one midterm and a final, along with discussion and participation counting for 20% from what I remember. We were given case briefs that were due weekly and were fairly easy and took about an hour total to complete. When I took the course again in Summer 2022, I had Soofia Lateef and she did an excellent job! Her class was structured the same as Cranor’s. She answered all your questions, made lecture slides available, and was very clear about the topics discussed. We talked about tort law, criminal law, and admin law only due to the 5 week condensed summer course. I also had a very fun and helpful TA! Only drawback to the course is that you have to purchase the textbook that Professor Cranor wrote himself which was around $90. 	4	8/16/2022
MATH004	6.07	David Weisbart is a really great guy, but I pretty much taught myself the material. There was a lot of homework and lack of coordination between the Prof and TAs.	8	12/19/2017
		Professor Mike curtis is cool but hates teaching pre calc. Finals and midterms are hard, do well on the quizzes 	8	12/17/2018
		curtis, was good if attend lecture and pay attention, tests and quizzes are basically the entire grade	5	6/4/2019
		Took with Mike Curtis. Study and you will do fine. He tells you to study for the midterms and finals during lecture.	6	12/30/2019
		I took this class with Burdick, a new professor. He's a poor lecturer, and I rarely went to class. The two midterms are an easier version of the sample midterms he posts (same problems, easier numbers), be sure to practice those. The midterms themselves are easy. The material itself isn't too hard, just try to understand the homework. The final was unfairly hard; I had a high A before and it brought me down to an A-.	4	2/28/2020
		quizzes are super easy, attendance not mandatory, no quiz makeups, Ben Russel is super understanding 	2	11/24/2020
		try to get BENJAMIN RUSSEL because he's a really great teacher, easy to follow, and is really flexible. Quizzes and midterms are easy. The material is pretty basic, didn't really have to study much outside of class if you pay attention during lecture and do the homework. 	4	12/12/2020
		I had Professor Curtis and he's really not bad at all. He teaches the lesson pretty clearly and always stays for office hours to work on questions that kids are struggling with. Personally, I had a really good Pre-Cal teacher in high school so it made the class go by a lot smoother. There were several homework assignments due every week, 1 quiz about every week, 2 midterms + 1 final. This class was pretty time consuming, mainly because I was always studying for the quizzes. If you've never taken Pre-Cal before you might struggle, but if you practice then you should be fine. 	7	12/18/2020
		I took this class during covid times with Michael Curtis. AVOID HIM. We had a quiz every Friday and we had 3-4 homework sections due on Tuesday's and Thursdays. each section was about 12-17 questions long. in my personal opinion he did not make the study guides like the tests. His study guides were a bunch of random questions from which he would make similar questions for the tests. Unless it is a complete emergency he does not try to understand students needs. 	9	12/22/2020
		Curtis is pretty cool professor but he is not flexible with the pandemic at all, the course is pretty fast paced so try not to fall behind, the workload is decent you have quizzes and online homework.	10	3/18/2021
		The midterms and finals are really hard. The online problems kind of help but a lot of studying is required.	8	3/28/2021
		"I had Curtis. As someone who is good at math and put in my full effort in this class, it was a struggle. Course work is decent, but midterms and final were really rough. It's nothing like the content we learned during lectures, or like our homework. Your best bet is to study the textbook (even though we barely go over it). Discussion quizzes are based off of textbook questions, and he creates questions using the textbook exercises for the ""big"" exams. Also, go to office hours since he helps go over content plus gives hints about exams that he doesn't give during lecture. He provides you with everything you need: section questions to study for quizzes, what material will be on the exams, small curves, but again he makes the class more tough than it really is. Also, avoid asking repetitive or his definition of ""easy"" questions, he is really snarky. "	8	3/30/2021
		I understand why people don't enjoy this class- it's very inflexible and black and white, but the information is pretty okay to learn. A lot of it is high school math and not terribly difficult. Pay attention in class, go to lecture, and use homework as a time to review questions. Professor Curtis is pretty good with a couple ec points during exams because he knows that students will make careless mistakes. Overall, pretty solid. He also drops a couple assignments too. 	3	6/3/2022
MATH005	6.94	Heavy work load with a lot of material to cover: make sure to stay up on the WeBWorK and written homework. Hope for Dr. Eric Weisbart - he is a very passionate and caring professor who'll jump through hoops to see you pass with a high grade.	7	4/15/2017
		Xinli Xiao had a really thick accent which made it hard for me to understand his lecture. So I never went to lecture and just self studied with ALEKS	4	7/1/2017
		Dr.Weisbart was a great professor. His classes and his notes were useful as a quick refresher. The exams were exactly the same as the ones on the midterm and the final. Homework is a good part of the sections. Get to know your TA they basically grade your homework and whether or not to get credit. 	6	8/24/2018
		David Weisbart was confusing during lectures and sometimes did not have examples that matched with homework problems. Had to ask TAs to solve and explain a lot of the problems.	7	12/17/2018
		You're gonna have to learn this class on your own. The lectures aren't great	7	1/11/2019
		Weisbart is a nice guy. He will however literally fuck you world up as his style of teaching is completely different from everyone else's. I took calc and I had no idea what he was teaching. Exams are hard and he expects a lot from you. His class really is the 5 units its worth. 	8	2/6/2019
		Avoid Weisbert. Makes some concepts unnecessarily difficult. Study a lot and do the homework for discussions. 2 midterms and a final.	7	6/16/2019
		David Weisbart is a really nice and caring professor, and you can tell he wants you to succeed. However, he over complicated a lot of the material and it will take a LOT of hard work to pass the class. 	9	12/10/2019
		"Try to avoid Weisbart, he's a cool dude, kinda funny and is really passionate about his work but honestly he sucks at teaching. However, he does post his outline/notes from lecture. Way he ""takes"" attendance are through in class quizzes maybe 2/3 times a week at the end of lecture, and he they're random, but you get full credit even if you answer is wrong."	7	12/10/2019
		This class was built for life science majors in CNAS specifically so don't take it unless in that range of majors. The math is not essentially hard once you understand it you just have to practice and re-practice to really get it. Had Prof. Weisbart, he's cool but his teaching style is entirely different than anything I have experienced. He doesn't give equation formulas during lectures other than in 2 instances. Go over ALL the syllabus questions and example exams as many midterm and final exam questions are literally derivations of those or similar. 2 midterms and final. My TA was Adam which really helped. Ended with a B thanks to failing the 1st midterm	7	12/16/2019
		If you get David Weisbart, get ready to study. But it is definitely not that hard to get a good grade in his class if you go to every lecture, go to office hours, do the extra credit, and ace all the worksheets. Since he doesn’t assign any homework, it is easy to fall behind but if you force yourself to follow along and do the syllabus questions he has posted, you’re on your way to an A!	4	12/18/2019
		David makes the class harder than it should. Just study ALL the solution problems in the syllabus ASAP! I can't emphasize enough! ASAP! 	8	12/20/2019
		Weisbart is seriously the worst teacher I have ever had. Good luck.	7	3/4/2020
		If you got prof tran, the lectures wont help you understand shit. Focus on the slides and vids, also attend the discussion, they teach more. ALSO the prof doesnt use his mic	9	10/12/2022
		Lectures were not very helpful so you have to do a lot of self study. It was mostly fine but there were a couple lessons that take a good amount of time to understand.	6	11/9/2022
		"Easy to pass if you have any sense of precalc in Highschool. Impossible if you're going in blind. After first 3 weeks, don't bother going to lectures, especially if you have Tran, the worksheets he goes over are useless. You're basically taking precalc in another language, nothing you google will make sense since everything is abstract and made up by Weisbart. Final is 50% of grade, however you're basically guaranteed the other 50%, and you only need 40% on final to pass if that's all you care about.

I highly recommend skipping lectures, and instead use all the time to watch the videos and practice over and over the hw exercises and midterm practices. Doing this got me an A+ since the final was easy. Don't fall behind, this class is harder to fail than it is to pass."	6	12/20/2022
MATH006A	4.62	I had Karl Schmidt for my professor and he was very easy. His lectures involve Kahoot at the end of class for attendance and extra credit. Most of everyone I know that had other teachers in this category of math did online math homework. The math homework is easy, but the online program is often difficult to use and requires a little bit of time to get used to it. Use Desmos a lot or the quadratic formula, don't do advanced calculus to solve the problems.	4	11/26/2018
		I had Prof. Sara Lapan. She's not a particularly good teacher imo. She definitely is very knowledgeable with math, but just isn't very good at teaching it. HW is weekly, and can take a while if you get confused. Midterm is ok, but she'll give you the opportunity to make up some points on it. Her point system is setup where it isn't too hard to pass, but learning the content itself is kind of tricky along the way.	3	12/11/2018
		"I had Prof. Lapan and she isn't that great at teaching. Knowing how to do some of the math is expected, or only taught once, and the lectures are her having us work out ""puzzles"" sitting with our discussion groups. There's a kahoot at the end for her to track your attendance. You can get points back on the midterm, but it was at most 20. Self study is key to passing. The online homework takes a lot of time to complete so don't procrastinate it. Final is cumulative, no curve,  same with midterm."	6	12/19/2018
		Professor Lapan is a terrible professor but she has tons of make-up points that help your grade out.	7	2/19/2019
		Took it with Dr. Lapan. Basic introduction to geometry and pre-calculus. Kahoot clicker questions, two midterms and one cumulative final. She really tends to take a simple concept and complicate it, so make sure to ask questions.	4	6/8/2019
		Took it the quarter that Lapan wasnt the primary instructor so I cant offer insight onto her teaching style, but I can say this about the class material. It is not hard math at all. Mix of Algebra II and Pre-Calc concepts, and if you honestly do all the homework, take notes, and make sure you understand all the concepts, you can easily get an B. Isn't hard to get an A, so long as your on top of the material and study like one to two hours a week outside of class and homework. Discussion is worksheets(graded on correctness) and you get groups, so it's not difficult. Otheriwise.. easy B, if the average effort is put in.	4	6/13/2019
		Pretty easy class, had professor Lapan. Just make sure to study and do the homework. It’s the hardest part of the class in my opinion but I honestly learned most of the material by just making sure I got 100s on all the homework assignments. She also gives lots of opportunities to get extra credit and has this thing called a midterm redo which allows you to get points back if you didn’t do so hot on the midterm.	5	12/17/2019
		Had prof Lapin and shes actually pretty nice but confusing when it comes to asking her questions. Her way of explaining questions makes no sense most of the time unless you truly understand the concept. Her homework consists of online homework that you get 3 tries on so it was relatively easy. She also lets you do midterm corrections to boost your midterm grade so thats helpful. Overall I would recommend taking her. 	4	11/30/2020
		Class was simple overall...took with Lapan in Fall 2020. It was review topics from algebra and geometry for most of the quarter and got into more complex topics like logarithms the final few weeks. Class has 3 unit tests and a final, all weighted the same, and Lapan drops the score of your lowest test, so technically if u bomb the final it can be wiped. There are also quizzes for each chapter (4) which are similar to homework problems. You can easily pass with Lapan by completing all the homework and doing decently on the quizzes and tests so TRY AND GET HER AS INSTRUCTOR.	9	1/3/2021
		Everything was online(including tests). Pretty easy class, do the homework and understand it and you should be good for the tests. 	5	9/13/2022
		Had Dr. Yeakel. All homework, quizzes, and tests were online. She gives lots of extra credit opportunities so take them while you can. Not a hard class, just make sure to put in the work and it should pay off.	3	12/9/2022
		Had Cannizzo for this class. She talks pretty light, so it's kinda hard to hear her. The class uses IMathAS that contains questions which gives you unlimited tries on hw and 3 tries on quizzes. All of the exams are also taken on this website, and you won't be able to see the answer until it gets graded grade, BUT the exams aren't in person. Write the work and submit the work into gradescope after the exam. The worksheets that I got during discussion correlated with the contents in the class for the most part. There are journals weekly, which requires to write the steps for 4 questions of your choice, which is honestly a bit tedious. Overall, the class isn't too bad; it's basically just a refresher from high school functions.	4	4/7/2023
MATH005A	5.50	Your grade is 100% dependent on your effort, if you study every worksheet and excersice sheet  and go to office hours and every discussio you will get a B minimum but if you go specail to the professor watch evrey lecture video alongside live lectures you will get an easy A. Concepts are not taught like your usual math class, a lot is giving foundation for your future calc class and understanding why a concept is the way it is. 	6	12/23/2022
		took it with dw fall 2022. videos that were provided to supplement the homework would only show you how to do the very basics, and leave you to parse out the word problems on your own. for someone who sucks at math, that was a little tough, but I went to discussion and I was fine. just make sure to keep up with the homework and it honestly isn't bad at all	5	1/10/2023
MATH006B	6.33	The work itself is easy, but if you have Lizheng Tao consider yourself done for. Curve is strong though. 	8	1/10/2018
		Took over summer so it was more fast paced, but even then the class was not bad at all. No curve, but there is a redo your lowest page on the midterm from 6A. Covers modules 5-8 and they are all easy but the only one I found challenging was 8 because its trig functions and they don't click in my head lol. Got C's on all exams/finals, but completed all homework/ discussion worksheets and ended with a 85% so do the homework and worksheets. 	4	8/27/2019
		I took this with professor Hung Tran spring quarter 2023. he just goes over worksheets during lectures so its kinds hard to learn that way for me. I had to search up everthing myself. HW due ever fridays at 11:59 and you have to pay for that website. The midterm was just like the practice tho. I just suck at math.	7	6/8/2023
MATH007A	4.33	Midterms and finals are just like the sample ones, memorize them and you'll do fine 	3	11/25/2018
		Sample midterms and finals are very similar to the actual exams. 	3	12/21/2018
		Had Professor Karl Smidtch. He is a horrible lecture (over complicates things) but his midterms and final are wayyyy easier than the ones given by other teachers. I would take his class because 7A is just derivatives and applications of derivatives so it isn't hard and his midterms/final are pretty easy. If you took calc before you're straight chillin in his class, but I didn't take calc in hs and still found 7A pretty chill. Study the mictotutorials though, he puts one of them on his final.	5	12/12/2019
		costello is a really good teacher, he explains his work it detail so you can understand how to solve similar problems. 2 midterms and a final, hw due every week online but you have unlimited tries per problem so its an easy 100%	5	3/20/2020
		Took with Costello, great professor. Has 2 midterms 1 Final that are relatively easy imo, as long as you attend lecture you’ll get a good grade because his lectures are clear and easy to understand. Final is worth 40% of grade and is cumulative, also has micro tutorials that aren’t due till finals week so lots of time to get them done. Online hw every week with unlimited tries so no excuse not to do, plus they’re relatively short. Discussion and lecture attendance not necessary but highly recommend you attend lectures, discussions were a waste of time imo.	4	6/17/2020
		I had henry tucker. he improved his organization skills every class and layed out the possible math questions for each concept on the following test. he gave us 4 sampe mid terms each midterm and gave us 4 sample finals which were, if not, identical to the real midterm and finals. 	4	12/28/2020
		I had Dr. Constantini during Fall 2020 and she's the sweetest person ever. Her lectures and TA discussions are not mandatory but she offers supplemental notes and recorded lectures. Homework consists of Microtutorials, worksheets,  and MyMathLab. She really does want you to do well and is always willing to help her students out. Her practice exams are really similar to her actual exams and all of them are unproctored and open notes. You don't even have to be in Zoom, she just emails you your version of the test and you have to turn it into GradeScope by a specific time. Material is mostly the first semester of AP Calc. 	4	1/5/2021
		i had robbie lopez as prof even tho he's apparently a grad student? super easy going jacked as fuck literal chad super good at explaining concepts. just do the homework and don't forget the micro-tutorials and u basically get an A	3	3/31/2021
		I took this class with Matthew Harper, it's pretty typical of what you would expect out of a Calculus class. His teaching style was a bit confusing/hard to follow at times but other than that it wasn't too difficult.	5	12/17/2021
		I took it with Professor Costello. He's pretty amazing in lectures and pretty chill. He's very informative in lectures where he'll explain how to do each calculus problems/examples along with some extra problems just for extra practice/pre-cautions. His office hours/emailing him are also pretty helpful as well where he'll guide you on the problems/questions in order to solve them. His exams are fair and average (not too easy nor too hard) without using a calculator. One thing to note for his exams is that there's one altered question based on the microtutorial vids, so do the microtutorial vids early as you can and try understand how to solve them. So, do the practice exams he give along with the microtutorial vids. Overall course is based on 1 midterm, 1 final, 5 discussion quizzes based on the recommended problems he give (1 quiz with lowest score will be dropped & you can use a calculator for the quizzes), weekly homework, and microtutorial vids. Grading is based on the percentage of each materials. Do recommend taking him for MATH007A. 	5	12/7/2022
		As someone who never actually learned anything in my pre-calc classes in high school, I found this class pretty challenging. However, I had Prof. Yang and he's honestly one of the nicest and most reasonable teachers I've ever had. His class is not hard, and his midterm and final are basically identical to the practice exams he posts. The curve for the class (found in his syllabus) also gives you a pretty big cushion, so as long as you put in a bit of effort, you should be fine in his class. 	7	1/5/2023
MATH007B	5.44	This class was really, really easy. I had Christina Va..(something complicated; greek) and it was fun. I did not pay much attention in class, but I was there. It was easier than AP calc. I used like 10% of my brain in class and got an A, but I know some people who had a hard time. I say just study, do the homework, and be attentive and it will all be okay. 	2	12/17/2018
		Very easy with Dr. Christina. Show up to office hours and you’ll definitely get an A 	3	1/13/2019
		Had Stefano Vidussi. Does not teach very well, rarely shows examples in class, so you're better off studying on your own. Midterm is easy, but final is much harder 	9	3/28/2019
		Avoid Gindi at all costs. He will show up to class at least 10-15 minutes late every lecture, give out hard exams, and will be condescending to those who asks questions. 	8	6/15/2019
		HELL	10	6/15/2019
		If you took calc AB in high school, this is basically the 2nd half of that class since it is all about integrals. Quizzes are very easy and midterm/final aren't as easy, but are not hard. I had Scott Atkinson who was a good professor and had a good TA as well. Some newer concepts not learned in calc AB are taught in the second half of the course. Make sure to understand all the concepts as some people struggle(maybe due to bad math background or using symbolab to do all the homework)	3	12/15/2019
		"Took it w Atkinson. He's not a bad prof, but I feel likes he's a little too roundabout and has a tendency to overcomplicate concepts. If you took Calc AB in hs, this is mainly a review w a few new tricks on familiar concepts. Homework is weekly and kind of a bother bc the system can be picky about ""correct"" answers. For instance, it often does not recognize answers that are equivalent to its own so you kind of have to solve problems very formally. Weekly quizzes in discussion, but the TAs do a great job of walking you through the concept and then quizzing you at the end of discussion. Tests aren't too bad"	6	12/17/2019
		Took it with Prof. Atkinson. Amazing guy but at times can be boring and repetitive. Make sure you pay attention and take notes :)	6	12/20/2019
		I had professor Zhanar Berikkyzy and hands down the best math professor at UCR. She is hella patient, and does not go fast at all. She truly wants nothing but the best for her students and even if you show the slightest interest by asking questions or office hours, she is extremely helpful and considerate. I struggled through 7B material, but she was extremely helpful in office hours and after class. I flew through 7A, but 7B was a struggle for me because I hate integrals but overall 7B isn't hard. Her midterms are similar to the ones in her class examples and quizzes that were given in discussion. 	6	3/30/2020
		Had Burdick. HONESTLY GOAT you have 1-2 homework assignments due every Friday with unlimited attempts. Asynchronous class but he held optional class at normal times and had office hours to go over any homework questions you have. Recorded lessons for the week posted Sundays and he records all his office hours and lectures. One worksheet a week for discussion (attendance optional) that you would turn in for grades. Provided four samples for every midterm (1&2) and the final exam. Very helpful. 	3	12/18/2020
		(Fall 2020 Via Zoom) I gave this class a 4/10 in difficultly because the concepts are not hard to grasp if you do the assigned homework and attend discussions as they do a good job of working step-by-step through difficult problems. I had Dr. Chen, and he was great. He gave us enough time to do homework problems and they were not long. The homework problems are more complex than those on the exams which I think is good because you will be prepared for the exams. The averages were about 80-85%. The midterms (2) and final are all free-response and must be worked out and turned in via Gradescope. As far as proctoring, he required us to log into zoom and have our cameras on and no calculators allowed. He also did offer one extra credit quiz. DOWNSIDE: He only uploads his notes that he takes during the live lecture but does not record the actual lecturing. However, he does upload example videos of him going through various problems for the modules.	4	12/28/2020
		I took this with Prof. Chen in Fall 2020, and I thought he was a really nice prof that wants his students to succeed. If you need anything, just contact him and he'd be happy to help you out however you need. Lectures were pretty boring (although I find all math lectures boring) but it was easy to follow. I took Calc BC in high school, so having had a lot of practice with integrals, this class was a breeze for me. My friend, who took Calc AB in high school, was less familiar with some of the material but they're still getting through the class with only mild difficulty; so make sure you pay attention in lecture!!! 	3	2/24/2021
		Took with Noble Williamson. He focuses on theorems and propositions on quizzes and exams so make sure you understand them. 	4	12/28/2022
		I had with Professor Zhang Zhenghe. He's a fast lecturer where he talks fast and sometimes do shortcuts during lecture examples without explanation as he may expects you to be familiarize with the learnings of 7A materials. All his lecture notes are just examples of the problems of the contents he'll be teaching. There's still online hw with unlimited amount of attempts to pass. Microtutorials are also there, but Zhang won't include the qs related to the microtutorial vids in the exams. Exams were quite average with some mostly doable and others a bit diffcult/tricky. Weekly discussion quizzes are based on the optional textbook problems that he'll give as part of extra practice. His office hours were very helpful as he'll help you try solve any calc problems (hw, exam, quiz) you may have experience with. Overall, I get the sense that he's trying his best to help you succeed despite the difficulties of the content and the way he teaches which he's an okay professor. I would suggest that you keep practicing the materials and try understand the process of the materials when solving them! 	7	3/31/2023
MATH009A	5.32	Specifically with Gerhard Gierz, the exams are open EVERYTHING even internet and the questions are literally taken from his homework! I got an A+ and showed up to like 70% of the classes but some of my friends who never showed up also got As	10	3/27/2017
		Never took calculus before and it kicked my ass. Got a C. Gerard Gierz, I believe was his name, let students use their electronic devices for the exam. I didn't utilize it properly because I did not know what the hell I was doing	8	7/1/2017
		Probably my easiest class this quarter even though I didn't take calculus in high school. I had Vasilakopoulou and she taught pretty well, even if it was a bit fast. Pay attention and ask questions, it will make sense.	3	12/10/2017
		Kadriye Nur Saglam is not a good professor; cannot explain things clearly. You're better off reading the textbook and never going to lecture. I heard she is better at teaching during office hours than lecture, though.	7	12/25/2017
		Attend lecture and sections. Both help out with getting material review. Class is exam and quiz heavy. If you need help there is many guides online and tools. There is review packets online that are extremely useful. 	5	8/24/2018
		I really liked having professor benson. He assigned hardly any homework, and his exams seemed very fair (if not a little easy). He will stare into your soul 	5	12/13/2019
		Brian Benson - Very enthusiastic and energetic teacher. Teaches us why things works and makes us show work and provide reasoning instead of plugging in numbers. He made the final exam and midterm much easier than the practice one posted by the department. If you already took AB, this class will be easy. Class average on midterms were around an 88% and i got a 102% on them. 	4	12/14/2019
		If you have prior calculus experience, it’s relatively easy and a good review.	4	12/17/2019
		Took it with Dr. Zilong Song (this was his first year teaching I think). He was pretty good but he had an accent that some may find hard to understand. Do at least the first and last problems of webwork and MAKE SURE to be up to date on microtutorials because those come in clutch at the end for bonus points. Midterms and finals are pretty easy, almost exactly like class examples and webwork but are not curved. go to discussion if you don't get something. study for discussion quizzes, they add up over time.	5	12/20/2019
		Took it with Professor Song, he writes out all of the notes for you and emails them. Just do the hw and review the notes and you should be fine.	5	2/18/2020
		I took this class with Professor Qi Zhang. He has an accent, but it wasn't too hard to understand him. He's also nice and cares about his students. It was my first time taking calc and I ended up with an A. Qi's lectures can be all over the place sometimes, but he still gets his point across. His office hours help if you don't understand something. For the homework, if you run out of tries, you can email him for more. Quizzes are given out during discussion; the problems depend on who your TA is. The midterm wasn't too bad, but you need to put in the time and effort to study. Because of the coronavirus, the final was online and open notes, but it would have been closed notes and in-person. 	6	3/29/2020
		Dr. Wang is extremely tough to follow. Don’t even bother going to lecture. 	8	5/7/2020
		I had Professor Xin Yang Fall 2020, he's super nice and always gives students access to lectures and lecture notes for the entire quarter which I found really helpful for the midterms. Considering the rigor of this course I honestly don't think it gets better than this cuz he explains everythinggg in depth and does it pretty well. He's also super reasonable and understanding. So try to get him if you take this course :) In terms of content, if you're a freshman and you didn't take any AP Calc courses but placed into this, its definitely gonna be overwhelming. There's always gonna be kids who know more than you since they had more experience with it. You can do well even if you procrastinate but beware that it's a LOT of cramming. Make sure you study for the quizzes because it's easy to forget considering how much we have to remember. Be attentive during lecture, you miss one thing and can get lost and then needa rewatch it. Also, he monitors the chat so you don't have to speak to participate. Overall, a rigorous course but he's a really good professor so you'll be in good hands :)	8	12/5/2020
		I had prof Xin Yang and we was a super sweet prof. He didn't take attendance, but lectures were super helpful. Tests and quizzes were all open note, but had some tricky questions that required you to apply concepts you had learned from the notes. It helps to have friends in the class who can help you if you get stuck on a homework problem or if you go to office hours. Also ask a lot of questions because it really helps.	7	12/21/2020
		Prof Gan - the best! No midterms, no finals. Just do the hw and quizzes and you're all set. Definitely take Wee Lian Gan. Just take him. !	3	3/4/2021
		If you took calculus in HS then thiss class should be nothing. I had Javier Gonzalez Anaya as my professor and he was amazing. I definitely recommend taking it with him.	1	12/2/2021
		2021 FALL ONLINE: As a person who has no special interested in math, this course is really hard and almost make me hate math. I am thinking the main reason comes from the professor (Ziv Ran) itself. He is a nice guy but horrible in explaining and simplifying the learning materials. I ended up not attending lectures and watch tons of YouTube videos and self studying. The midterm and final exam are nothing similar to the practice one that he provided. If you are not a big brain or a productive learner, avoid taking any math class with him or your GPA suffers.	6	12/13/2021
		I had the class with Javier Gonzales. The class was one of the easiest that I took in my fall quarter. This class is mainly about differentiation, which is not a hard topic at all to grasp conceptually. Add on top of that the fact that you get a page long cheat sheet for the midterm and the final. The homework is done through webwork and you get 5 attempts per question, but the questions are very manageable and is good practice for the midterms and the finals. The midterm and final combined make up around 70% of your grade so make sure you study for them. The midterm was extremely easy but the final was a big step up. But there was a huge curve at the end of the quarter and one of my friends went from a D to a B. The professor is very understanding and nice.	3	2/11/2022
		Took with Professor Javier Anaya Gonzalez Fall 2021. He is FANTASTIC and gives fantastic lecturers. He does his best to understand and help students. We had videos with imbedded questions in it called micro tutorials -- those were horrible though. He didn't have a ton of control over the program itself so that was difficult. HW was done through webwork (free) and you had 3 chances to get a question correct. My TA was really great too (Daley Thomale). She's very helpful and nice -- go to her office hours! Quizzes were given weekly but with some exceptions (total of 7 quizzes). The professor allowed us a cheat sheet for the midterm and final. The midterm is 1000% doable and can be very easy! Review HW, notes, and sample exams to succeed. The final was much harder though; after feedback from students, he curved it. He's always open to feedback and remembers you. 	7	11/6/2022
		Professor Gonzalez. Easy make sure you pay attention and take notes it will help you in the long run. Midterms and Exams are relatively easy. He gives you practice for midterms and exams to help you prepare. Overall Great professor and would 10/10 recommend,	5	11/11/2022
		Content is pretty much only limits and derivatives, so fairly easy if you took Calculus in high school. Prof Feng Xu was not good at explaining the content at all. He does practice problems from the textbook during lecture and assigns weekly homework (not a lot of work at all). He also holds review sessions before the midterm and final that are fairly similar to the actual exams. The final and midterm together are worth 75% of your grade but getting an A is doable. 	4	1/2/2023
		Took the class with Xin Yang spring 2021. The only math class in my whole life where I have earned an A. It was my first calculus class as well so I feel like that shows how well yang teaches. Best most no nonsense teacher ive ever had. simple straight to the point. he also wrote notes before hand for us and posted them before class so we could follow along during class without having to rush and write. tests were extremely fair even tho i did struggle on them. Overall super fair and gave us everything we needed to succeed. Only math class at UCR where i felt the TA didnt carry the whole course. 	4	2/23/2023
		Had Professor Yat Poon. He was honestly an amazing professor; one of my favorites at the moment. He had a good sense of humor, the midterm wasn't necessarily too bad, mainly because the concepts at first were pretty easy to comprehend, as well as he nailed the course material in your head very well. The final is alright, just need to study for maybe an hour and I'm positive you will do amazing. If I could have this professor again, I totally would love to.	4	6/7/2023
		My teacher really didn't explain shit. I really suggest not going to class but spending that time doing khan academy and videos because ucr professors and terrible at explaining.	8	6/9/2023
MATH009B	4.88	Lopez-Garcia is a great professor	6	3/26/2017
		similar to high school AP calculus	6	3/27/2017
		Fernando Lopez-Garcia was a good professor and good looking too. I understood everything until we got to divergence and convergence. Homework was graded fairly, but the quizzes were not given any partial credits.	6	7/1/2017
		Avoid Chenxu He as your professor. First 3/4 of class were easy, but towards the end it became moderately difficult. He also doesn't let you use notes or cheatsheets in exams, which is a let down considering this class was mostly utilizing and memorizing identities.	5	12/19/2017
		"Prof. Theerakarn was definitely new to teaching. He did not explain well to a point where there everyone was confused and one girl would constantly ask him ""I did not understand any of that, can you explain the whole thing over again?"" Midterm was just like the practice midterm. The final had a few curveballs. Midterm and final were pretty easy if you understood the material and the TAs graded really leniently."	4	12/30/2018
		If you've taken AP Calculus AB in high school, you know a good portion of the material already. Know how to do the practice midterms and finals, as they are a good representation of the actual exams you will take. I had Jose Gonzalez, and he is probably one of the best professors I've had so far. 	2	3/26/2019
		Like most other math classes at this level, if you're good at running through problems without making careless errors and can understand the concepts and how they apply to the actual formulas, you should do alright. First half of the class is just the FTC, U-Subs, and integration by parts, second half is application problems and stuff like trig sub. Still hard enough, but not GPA-ruining if you're willing to put in the work. 	6	12/10/2019
		Had Po-ning Chen, Hw was super easy, one midterm/final that are extremely similar to the practice tests that he provides 	5	12/10/2019
		Hard tests, professors are hit or miss on quality depending on who you get. Tests are different between sections and difficulty also varies by professor. Every question missed on the final is half a grade down so it is hard to keep an A	8	12/13/2019
		Had Po-Ning Chen. He was a pretty good lecturer, posted his slides and lecture notes online after class. Unlimited tries on homework questions. I took AP Calculus AB in high school, and most of the stuff I learned in 9B, I had already learned in high school. Midterm was extremely, extremely easy. Final was a bit more difficult than midterm in my opinion. 	5	12/14/2019
		Fall 2019. Took with Liwei Chen. If you took AP Calculus in High School, class is very easy because it's material from AP Calc. Online HW was easy if you understood the material, but annoying. Quizzes during discussions which were mildly difficult. 1 Midterm and 1 Final.	5	2/25/2020
		Took it with John Baez. Very passionate teacher and explains the concepts in depth. Put in the effort and go to office hours for help. Homework is online and tests are almost identical to practice exams. Ended with an A+	4	3/7/2020
		Had prof qi zhang spring 2020, aka corona season lol. He went really fast, spent too much time on easy concepts and too little time on the harder ones. this class is very straightforward. webwork due every week, microtutorials, and a final for me. its really not bad at all	4	6/12/2020
		Had Po-Ning Chen. The class was really easy if you've taken AP Calc in highschool. The only thing I didn't like was how the finals felt compared to everything else in the class. Much harder than the rest of the stuff but might've just not studied hard enough. Would recommend overall.	3	9/30/2020
		I had Sarah Yeakel. You have to make sure you attend to class, watch YuJa videos, do hw, and do the weekly worksheets to stay on top of the class. There’s also weekly quizzes and microtutorials.	7	11/25/2020
		I had Dr. Wee Liang Gan, He is very kind and will answer emails right away. Sometimes he does not explain context? To avoid confusion, pre-view the textbook before the class. it takes about 15 minutes to do so, and makes the class easier to understand. He gave no midterm or final, but he gave 10, 10 minute quizzes for each chapter. The quizzes are a bit rushed, but it is not that hard. Just review the homework questions by finishing them in a spread out manner, then reviewing them the day before the test. It is not a hard class to get an A in. If you are ever confused, send an email. Be careful on quizzes and take organized notes, because quizzes are open book/note. The class structure is organized and easy to understand.  	4	12/20/2020
		Had this class with John Baez. Would definitely recommend him, as long as you have a solid Math9A (or AP Calculus AB) knowledge, this class is mostly a breeze. 	4	5/22/2021
		With Gonzalex I thought that he was super helpful and very kind but his exams and the material are no joke. He has 2 midterms which have 3 questions that are a and b questions, 1 final so you need to study hard for these since 1 answer wrong brings your test grade down a whole letter. Had webwork problems for the homework. If you're good at calculus this class should be very easy 	8	6/1/2021
		I had Proffesor Dugan for this course. The quizzes and midterm were easy to do. However, the final was worth 45% of your grade and it was extremely hard. I went from an A- to a B- because of the final.	7	12/28/2021
		Winter 22. Had Po-Ning Chen. He is a good professor. Midterm was very similar to the practice midterm. His hw and quizzes were also similar to in class problems. Final was not hard but it was not on the same easy level as midterm. 	2	3/17/2022
		I had Professor Ishan and he's a great professor. He explains everything very well in class, answers questions, is helpful in office hours, and is pretty clear about what he expects. The actual course isn't bad at all, you just need to make sure you keep up with the pace, and continue doing homework. 	4	10/26/2022
		if you took AP calc A this class is super easy. Jose gonzalez is amazing professor. online lectures and the midterm and final are 100x easier than the homework	1	2/11/2023
		Hard class for me but easy to get away with not going to class/	4	6/9/2023
MATH009C	6.14	Basically unrelated to 9A or 9B so beware	8	3/29/2017
		Not bad if you can study for it, sick curves	6	3/29/2017
		It's known to be a tricky course but honestly if you study the theorems enough to where you know them like the back of your hand you'll be fine. 	4	3/31/2017
		This class mainly covers power series and is an easy A for most people, especially if you took AP Calculus BC in high school. Two quizzes, one midterm and a final. Do your homework and you will be fine. Ended with an A- because I forgot one formula which basically costed my A. The midterm and final were similar to the practice ones given by the professor so that should be your main mode of studying.	3	12/18/2017
		Nothing like 9A or 9B. New concepts make it hard to apply anything you previously learned here. As long as you pay attention and attend lectures and practice, you'll be good.	7	3/25/2018
		Ziv Ran is probably the worst professor in the 9 series as he tends to overcomplicate simple concepts in lecture while giving difficult problems in exams. Quizzes and homework are easy and make up a decent chunk of your grade. 	7	3/28/2018
		Had Dong, basically gives you midterm and final the lecture before	7	3/28/2018
		Professor Gindi is horrible at teaching. The quarter ended and we were missing 3 weeks worth of material.	4	12/15/2018
		"Fall 2018 Quarter - Professor Gindi
Our midterm average was a 70.8 IIRC - he said since our midterm average was above a 70, he wouldn't curve it... The final screwed me over. Cannot miss a single lecture as some of the stuff he goes over in class is on the midterm/final and isn't found in the textbook... overall this class was extremely difficult in my opinion. There is a pretty large curve though (90 A, 85 A-, 80 B+ etc.)"	8	12/18/2018
		Costello is great, but can spend a lot of time on the theory and proofs behind certain concepts. 	5	2/19/2019
		Material isn't too hard, but the class difficulty is dependent upon the professor you have. Midterm and final was similar to the practice problems given to us. If you have Kadriye Nur Saglam, I'd try to steer clear. She fell behind schedule frequently and had to rush through the material to finish the course before the final exam.	5	3/26/2019
		"I had Dr. Diaz. He's fairly good at teaching and he's more than willing to help you with any questions that you may have or if you're stuck on a homework problem. Math009C is strange at first because it's NOTHING like Math009B or 9A and it's very stressful because you're going to be like ""what have I gotten myself into."" My advice is just realize that this class is 75% memorization and 25% math manipulation and start memorizing as soon as you can... I eventually got used to it in the end but even toward the midterm I was stressed out about this class."	8	3/31/2019
		Took it with John Baez. He is a very theoretical professor and doesn’t teach the best. I did very well in 9A and 9B but I had to fight for a B in this class. Always clicker questions every lecture but discussion quizzes were always on the clicker which i thought was pretty cool. 	8	10/25/2019
		Midterm mostly had questions from in class examples or from the written homework.	3	11/14/2019
		Difficult class. Taylor polynomials and series are absolutely brutal and will destroy you if you do not understand them. Zhenghe Zhang is a great professor and if you go to office hours he will definitely help you. The course material is difficult but you can get an A if you put in a lot of effort. Make sure to get 100% on quizzes as it's based off the hw. The midterm is 30% and the final is 50%, so you really have to study hard and make sure you do a lot of practice problems and not make any silly mistakes.	7	12/12/2019
		Took it with Mahesh. He has easy midterms and finals. the curve is preset (A+ 95-100 A 90-95 A- 85-90). his lectures are extremely boring and useless so do problems out of the book as much as you can. quizzes cover the really easy problems of each concept. they are given out during discussion so go to discussion!!	2	12/21/2019
		"avoid song zilong, accent is understandable but i spend a heavy amount of time trying to understand wtf hes saying and dont really have the brain power at 8am to actually comprehend it. he has a tablet for notetaking that he projects and will switch to a new page with complete disregard for if anyone is still unfinished copying down on what he wrote, which is often.
webwork is also due at 10pm and not 11:59pm which is a huge pain in the ass"	7	2/5/2020
		Took it with Zilong Song, would not recommend because he has a very static voice and just writes on his device and goes over a bunch of examples without really explaining the concept well. The first half of the class isn’t too bad you just need to memorize the different types of convergence tests but the second half really picks up. I didn’t take Calc BC in hs so I found this class kinda hard but if you just watch YouTube videos on the concepts covered (I recommend organic chemistry tutor) you should be fine. 	6	6/12/2020
		Avoid discussion for Math 009C with Ruoyi Wang at all costs. I had her discussion over zoom. She consistently started classes late and always talked like she was dreading the class. When asked questions, she failed to be helpful and just expected everyone to figure it out. 	6	12/1/2021
		Too many proofs that don't lead anywhere. Ziv Ran spent like 30 minutes of the class trying to break down these 1 sentence theorems instead of doing practice problems and teaching you how to do the homework. Honestly if you get him just use Organic Chemistry tutor on Youtube and pray you have a good TA to explain some of the convoluted homework problems 	7	6/2/2022
		I had Prof. Po-Ning Chen and he's a fair test maker. His study guides are really good preperation for the midterm and final. His lectures are a little fast and hard to understand at first. My TA Aaron Goodwin was a godsend and helped me understand a lot of the material. Ask the professor questions during lectures so that he slows down but he does post his slides after so make sure to review those. 	6	6/18/2022
		DO NOT TAKE WITH ZIV RAN unless you are good at math and can self teach you can survive and get a good grade. Ran has huge curves bc a MAJORITY of the class could not keep up with the material and concepts. the class was mainly taught by the tas and they would hold hour long study sessions outside of discussion because a lot of us were struggling. i had a 68 in the class after the final and got a b- so the curve is humongous. if you are confident in math and don’t need the help of a professor you can use the fact that his curve is large to your advantage and get an A with a 80% but if you are like me and struggled with 9b and 9a do not take with ziv	10	1/9/2023
		The material is pretty much the same as AP Calc BC, the professor (Ziv Ran) is pretty generous with the curves. quiz every week but is super easy if pay attention in discussions. 	6	2/5/2023
MATH010A	4.72	Had a 100% until the final, which fucked me. Ended up with a B+	6	3/27/2017
		Math is hard in general for me, but in general, practice makes perfect, so if you put in the time and effort, you should be fine.	9	3/31/2017
		If you're good with first-year calculus, this class is a breeze. It helps even more if you've already taken MATH 031 (though some say to take 10A first). Took it with Neal. He was a pretty good professor, but he confused himself at some points in the lecture. 	4	12/22/2017
		Take Bingyuan Liu, since he takes his time teaching the material and is an easy teacher. Do good on the midterm, complete all the homework, and do good on the quizzes. The final will reflect the structure of the homework, so its an easy A.	2	6/16/2018
		Took it with Professor Po-Ning Chen. Provides detailed lecture notes that are in a very easy to read format and follow extremely well in lecture. Midterm and final exam are very close to the study guides. Homework and quizzes are not too difficult. He prepares you well and responds quickly to any questions. 	4	12/12/2018
		This is honestly easier than 9B. It's basically 9A but you have an extra variable. Just do the homework and practice problems and you'll be set.	4	12/16/2018
		Took it with Neal Livesay. Looking back it wasn't so bad, but I made it difficult for myself because I didn't do enough practice problems for the midterm and I got a 50%. That being said do some practice problems every week and you should do fine. Lectures were good and contained all the material for the midterms and finals, much better than the book that has a lot of jargon that makes the material difficult. Homework was overall ok, there was only one long homework assignment(2-4 hours). The midterms and finals and class overall aren't curved, but he does boost everyones midterm and finals by the difference of the highest score and the max score. For example, if the midterm is out of 30 points and the highest score is 28, he gives everyone 2 extra points on their midterm grade. He also tells you whats going to be on the midterm and final the day before. 	4	3/2/2019
		Took it with Gan Wee, it was suuuuper easy. He allowed a full page front and back of notes during the midterm and final. Had 5 point quizzes that you got full credit for as long as you get 3 or more problems correct. Homework has unlimited chances on webassign (except multiple choice but those didn't show up often). Practice exams are pretty similar to actual exams except the final had a surprise from the first half of the class that seemed to trip a lot of people up since it wasn't on the practice, but it is cumulative so we should've been prepared.	2	3/21/2019
		LOOK for professor Vasilakopoulou, Christina! She's a really good professor and the class isn't easy but she teaches well so its sort of easy. 	2	6/3/2019
		I found it SO much easier than 9C. Prof Lapan was a great prof and I kind of wish I have her again since she explained things relatively well and she's pretty friendly and willing to explain things again to you if needed.	5	6/16/2019
		The class is pretty straight forward. Easier than 9C in my opinion. Just study class notes. Take with Vasilopoukou she is a fantastic professor. DO HER WORKSHEETS	4	9/23/2019
		I took the class with Costantini, she was honestly so nice and helpful. None of the questions on the midterm and final were curve balls. She gives practice problems for both exams. Overall, pretty easy class. 	3	12/10/2019
		Took the class with Tucker. He prepares you for exactly what will be on the exams and his practice midterm and finals are very similar to the actual exams.	3	12/17/2019
		MATH010A is a very difficult class. I would say it's harder than MATH009C, which I already struggled in. Avoid Kelliher at all costs, and stay on top of the material!	6	3/21/2020
		Not as much calc as ppl think 	5	3/21/2020
		There is a notable amount of material, but most concepts are fairly straightforward. If your professor has open-book exams, it should be an easy A. I had Frederick Wilhelm (Fall 2020). He was a really great teacher, and you could tell he likes what he does. However, the exams were closed-book. Basically, if you understand basic linear algebra and Math 009A, this class is very manageable.	5	12/16/2020
		Took it online Fall 2020 pandemic with Prof Fred Wilhelm. He's knows the material well and is often happy to help. Overall the class wasn't too bad. There were weekly quizzes and homework, 1 midterm and 1 final. He uses 3 grading scales so there are many ways to get an A even if you mess up somewhere. 	5	12/28/2020
		Took it with Vidussi; had some technical difficulties, but did not intrude on learning environment. He records all the lectures so class attendance isn't necessarily mandatory. Homework is 1 online worksheet (usually between 7-25 questions) per lesson. Not a very demanding class. If you regularly attend lectures and discussions, and do your homework, you will be fine. The midterm/final is exactly like the practice ones he gives, so be sure to do them.	6	3/15/2021
		I took Professor Vidussi, and all I can say is that he is a nice, wholesome person however he can’t really teach. He spends all lecture on theorems and 1-3 examples which makes it extremely difficult to do the homework as the material is not reflecting off theorems. Most people stop attending lecture and independently studied the textbook. Exams were not bad since he provided a sample midterm(which was super helpful) but don’t expect it to be identical to the exam. Lastly, his exams are timed to be 30minutes so you must rush through each problem. 	6	3/16/2021
		Unlike 9A, most of this class isn't actually about calculus but rather general problems involving 3D space/matrices. If you autopiloted through 9A this class may be hard for you but if you can think though a problem conceptually you should do fine. 	6	3/19/2021
		Had this class with Alessandra Costantini, she is an excellent professor and taught the material very well. The class was pretty easy from how she taught the material.	4	5/22/2021
		Took it with instructor Jonathan Alcaraz during Summer 2021 (online) and he was the MOST lenient instructor/prof I have ever had in a STEM class.  Had weekly quizzes (worth 30% of your grade, not proctored) where there would be three problems and you only needed to solve two (each question was worth 4 points, but total grade of the quiz was out of 6).  You can do all three to get partial points to get 8/6.  Attendance was mandatory, but it was worth 20% of your grade (your final was worth 20%), simply joining the class via Zoom will give you your attendance credit.  He also offers as much extra credit you need to get your attendance grade up (2-3 sentences about the history of any topic covered during the course).  Ended up with a 97% in the class, just go to lecture and do not fall behind on the homework.	4	8/28/2021
		Took it with Professor Lapidus. The course itself was easy, mainly because the quiz problems were very straightforward, and we had a group project instead of final test. There were a lot of homework. There were many chances for extra credit.	5	12/15/2021
		"I took the class with Stefano Vidussi in the Winter of 2022. This class is very different from the intro to Calculus series, but if you attend lectures and ask questions during discussion, you’ll be fine. While my professor had a bit of an accent and spent most of the lecture proving equations rather than showing examples, the grading scale was generous and I ended the class with an A. 
"	6	3/22/2022
		Way easier than 9C. The kinds of problems you do are more complex but everything makes more sense imo. Whenever I struggled on the hw I just went to my teacher's office hours and usually it was fine after a simple explanation. Unlike 9C. Professor Qi Zhang is super chill. 	3	6/2/2022
		Prof Zheng -- honestly, the class wasn't as bad as people told me. The first half was easy but the difficulty increases as the quarter goes by. Make sure you understand how each example is solved and you should be good. Had to put in some work, so def not an easy A.	7	8/22/2022
		I took this class with Brian Collier in Winter 2023. He is an exceptional instructor and teaches quite well, though the pace might be too quick for some, as it was for me. The content itself wasn't too hard, but I did need to consult the TAs and the textbook some of the time. Topics covered in the course include vector operations, matrices, taking derivatives, calculating extrema, and Taylor theorem in multiple dimensions. His grades are also weighted quite generously, with 40% of the grade on homework. He also gives out a lot of helpful practice material for the midterm and the final. Overall just brush up on derivatives and some precalc stuff and you should be fine going into this course.	5	3/26/2023
MATH010B	7.09	The first half is easy, the second half is pretty hard. Do well on the midterm, hw and quizzes and you should be fine. If you made it this far you can make it through another math class! Good luck!	7	3/28/2018
		I took it with Benson, he has no practice exams which sucked because it's hard to find supplemental material for this course. It was his first time teaching 10B so I don't know if it'll get any better but he confused himself a lot and constantly went back to change parts of an example which led to some messy notes. There's a quiz every week, lowest is dropped. He puts one or two problems from lectures in his exams so I would recommend going to class. Also go to his office hours, he gave someone (who always went to his OH) extra credit on the midterm even though he never mentioned that extra credit was possible. He's obviously passionate about math but seems to have a hard time explaining it in simpler terms. I'm pretty sure I'll pass but everyone I know got below 50% on the midterm.	8	3/21/2019
		Take with Yat tin Chow, hes very passionate about the subject and very very generous with his curve. The first half is easy but the second part is Really hard.	7	12/15/2019
		I thought the book was full of jargon and hard af to read. Had costantini, and thank her notes and lectures were good enough (not great) so that I didn’t have to read the book. Her quizzes and exams are straightforward and the practice exams are a good representation of the actual. Had her for 10A as well. The content in 10B is more brainhurt and I needed a lot more time to digest material. Visualizing wtf is going on helped me a lot.	7	5/8/2020
		this class is significantly more challenging than 10A and the 9 series, try to take Henry Tucker, he gives out a sample midterm that is basically identical to the midterm and step by step solutions for these samples. if you know how to do the questions on the sample midterm you'll get a good grade on the midterm and a really good grade in the class.	8	11/20/2021
		I took the class with Professor Weitao Chen. The class itself was easy on its first half, its difficulty bumped up quite a bit in the second half. Chen is a fine professor, her teaching involves solving many specific examples. Her teaching speed is fast, I usually cannot keep up with her pace when I take lecture notes. The midterm was easy, final was a lot harder than the midterm.	6	3/24/2022
		Take the course with Bun Wong. He's super helpful and and his midterms and finals are just like the homework. 	8	4/16/2022
		I took this course with Henry Tucker in the Spring of 2022. This class is very different from MATH 010A, and it can be significantly more challenging at some points (especially after the first midterm). However, Henry Tucker made the class doable! Many of the midterm questions are similar to the practice midterm, and he often goes over the questions in lecture. There is no curve, but he offers a ton of extra credit in the form of “Homework Journals” and other EC assignments. Despite literally failing the second midterm, I ended the class with an A+. 	7	6/20/2022
		My professor was Hassan Attarchi. He was an ok-ish professor. His lectures were kinda boring. He does help a lot though. 	8	4/7/2023
MATH011	4.67	Didn't really go to class, didn't really understand the material but ended up with an A- somehow	4	3/28/2017
		"Take the class with Yilan Tan if possible; he is super enthusiastic, friendly and helpful. Not to mention he curves the class immensely(I somehow got an A despite not ""feeling"" like I put enough effort to warrant it, if that makes sense)."	1	6/28/2017
		Took the class with Jacob Greenstein. 70% weekly quizzes and 30% final. All the quizzes had 50% EC, so some students didn't even have to take the final to get an A. I didn't go to class. Study off of the homework solutions before the quiz and it's an easy A+	1	12/9/2017
		Took it with Neal Livesay. 40% Final, 60% quizzes. He basically told you what would be on the quiz that week and the final consisted of questions very similar to the quiz questions. I honestly didn't understand what I was doing but I got an A by listening to his hints in lecture.	6	3/21/2019
		Had Dr. Livesay. Study the proofs and you'll be fine.	7	6/15/2019
		CS011 with Livesay was hard in the beginning until you realize all the quiz questions are either verbatim from examples in lecture or from his suggested problems list that he gives answers to more than 3/4 of. The midterm and final are so similar to previous quarters so if you have a friend that was in it before you, try getting it from them. He also drops your lowest quiz as well. Overall just study the topics and examples for that weeks quiz and you’re bound to get 100% on all of them.	6	6/16/2019
		Had Greenstein. Not a very good lecturer, but offers more than enough extra credit to make the class a breeze. Quizzes during discussions; it’s more than enough just to glance at the hw before. Didn’t have to take the final if you had a grade you wanted by the time of the final. 	4	3/21/2020
		If you have Jacob Greenstein as your professor, it's the biggest dub in the world. No midterm, just 60% quizzes and 40% final. He gives 30% extra credit for watching his video tutorials online, and a max of 20% extra credit on quizzes, so you might not even have to take the final to get an A in the class. His lectures aren't really helpful, study off of the slides and the video tutorials for the quizzes. Quizzes are like the homework problems, just ask the TAs to go over some of the HW questions before the quiz is handed to you. If you have anyone other than Greenstein, this class is very difficult. Many of my friends who had other professors, and it was extremely hard for them. Some barely passed with a C-, but they will be prepared for CS111, which builds upon this course.	4	3/21/2020
		Avoid professor Bin Sun if it’s possible, his (I think) Korean accent is such a barrier that his lectures are slow as heck. We had three subsitutes and they were all far better	7	3/21/2020
		"I had Neal Livesay. He's a nice guy but often times has trouble explaining abstract concepts like why a certain rule makes sense which is really what a lot of students struggle with since this class is not that intuitive. Honestly I felt like I didn’t really know what I was doing for most of this quarter but I just looked at his solutions for the practice problems, tried to find some sort of pattern, and did the same thing. Try to study for this class and attend lecture and make sure you have all the notes written down so you can clarify it on discussion. Still
Probably won’t make sense lol. Do well on quizzes and study for the final cuz it’s a huge chunk of the grade (50%)"	4	6/12/2020
		Had this during coronaszn. Not sure how much that affects the difficulty of this class, but I had prof livesay and it was fairly tough. He was a great prof overall, but a lot of the shorthand notation he used nobody was fully familiar with and he acted like it was common knowledge when he'd write those hieroglyphics on the board lol. I crammed the exams bc i had other difficult classes to cater to, but I'd like to say i did fine. Just make sure you do the practice problems and try to not let this class sit on the backburner like i did. study frequently, bc a lot of this class is very new in terms of notation. its like learning another language kinda. a bunch of proofs too. however, once you get that down its pretty straightforward	5	6/12/2020
		Probably the easiest math class I've ever taken at UCR. The class is mostly focused on logic and proofs as opposed to raw computation but they're super easy to learn. I rarely attended lectures or discussions and got a nearly perfect score on the final. 	3	3/19/2021
		Take this class with Neal Livesay if possible. Explains all the material very clearly and was very knowledgeable. 	3	5/22/2021
		(Spring'21 - online) - Prof Jacob Greenstein - highly recommend you take Prof Greenstein as there are a lot of ways to earn extra credit, I didn't even give the final and ended the class with an A+ - Easy if you understand the theory but difficult otherwise. Good luck.	4	6/14/2021
		Took this class with Dr. Sayan Das in Fall 2022. Honestly I was initially very worried going into discrete math for the first time (it was also my first quarter at UCR as well) but all doubts were relieved the first week into the quarter. His teaching style is very intuitive and I really liked his attitude throughout. I very rarely had to consult the textbook, since he is very open to helping clarify any unclear info about the course material. He also records lectures and his course was hybrid, but I would still recommend going in-person anyway. As long as you pay attention in class you should do fine on homework assignments and midterms/finals. Topics include number theory, set theory, propositional logic, and mapping.	4	3/26/2023
		"Took this with Javier in Winter 2023. 40% of your grade was based on videos you had to watch as homework. Most of the videos only had one question you had to answer, but there were a few with more. You could retry the question as many times as you wanted though and the correct answer was usually given to you if you answered the question wrong twice, so there was really no reason, not to get 100% in this section. There were also optional videos that could earn you up to 10% extra credit. There were 4 quizzes throughout the course. The quizzes were out of 10 points and each quiz was worth 10% of your grade. These quizzes were impossible to pass if you didn't do any form of studying. The final was multiple choice and worth 20% of your grade. Not too difficult and not too easy, but just like the quizzes, impossible to pass if you didn't do any studying.
The class overall, wasn't too difficult, but a lot of the concepts felt ""foreign"" and even when I did get the right answer in a quiz, I never felt confident when I was writing the answer. Javier is a good professor, and know this because this wasn't my first time having him as a professor, but I feel like this course wasn't his strong suit, and at times he couldn't really explain some of the concepts to the best of his ability. Still, he was accomadating and would push back due dates on videos and quizzes if he felt that people would be falling behind, and made this weird course feel a little bit easier."	5	3/27/2023
MATH022	6.33	I took calculus back in highschool, so this class was a breeze to me. But for the people who didnt take this. this class is a bit challenging... recommend studying with a friend who is good at math carry your way to pass	8	11/21/2018
		Took calc in hs and got a C took Curtis's class and ended up with 102% (gives extra credit on midterms). Just do the work and you will get an A, ppl who complain about the work and don't do anything get less.	4	12/15/2018
		Only the quizzes are sort of easy but they are only worth 25% of the class. The midterms and final however are super hard. Doesnt help that the class was at 8 AM either. 	9	4/9/2019
		took with curtis, if attend lecture to take notes is ez, you have to keep up	7	6/4/2019
		Professor Curtis is good. The class is hard, so you need to study a lot and attend class to get a good grade. The class moves through material really quickly	8	11/14/2019
		easy class if you took ap calc ab/bc in high school. as long as you go to lecture + take notes + review with the homework a little, you'll be fine!	4	12/7/2019
		Its a painnnn but Curtis does try to make it as easy as possible. Lot of self studying bc class goes too fast. Dont skip lecture. Study guides etc always match the quizzes/exams. Discussion 2x a week: one day a worksheet, one day a quiz, so cant really skip. Then 2 midterms & final exam. Tri Phan was an awesome TA, would recommend. Online hw Webassign is hell and will take up hours of a week.	7	12/10/2019
		Bit challenging if you haven't taken calc before. Curtis tries to make it less of a drag, he tells you exactly what will be on the midterm and final. Make sure to do all the work in discussion and go to curtis's office hours if you need help. attending lecture helps a lot even though its 8am	5	5/31/2020
		Curtis is assigns a lot of homework and it takes a bit of time to finish even if you are good at Calculus, but it prepares you for his tests. Work hard and you will be fine.	5	6/21/2020
		MATH022 with Curtis, this is not an easy A class but not an impossible A either. There are weekly quizzes, two midterms, 1 cumulative final, discussion worksheets, and webassign homework. If you go to all the lectures, stay on top of homework and do all study guide questions before tests/exams you will get an A. The more work you put in the better your grade will be. Be prepared to spend time on this class. Don’t let Curtis intimidate or scare you, especially kids who came straight from high school pre-calc. There is no trig and very little pre-calc in this class. Do NOT miss lecture or skip study guide q’s (he takes study guide questions and puts them directly on the quiz.) Also, try to make a couple study buddies- it will go a long way. Not difficult, just time-consuming.	6	1/20/2022
		Took with Curtis Winter 2022. A lot of people talk bad about Curtis, I personally thought he did a good job teaching and managing the class. I never took Calc in high school, so learning new, sometimes difficult content at a quarter system pace was challenging. For someone who's taken Calc before, this class is a breeze. It just depends on which category you fall in. There is HOURS of homework, and the quizzes can sometimes be difficult if you don't do the study guides he assigns. I will stress this--Do the study guides--the quizzes are nearly exactly like study guide questions and you also benefit by getting additional practice. The reason why there is so much work is because practice really does determine your success in this class. He gives out an extremely detailed Midterm and Final Exam, you know almost exactly how many questions and what type of questions you will be tested on. In addition, he also gives out sample final and midterms and the questions are nearly always the same. Going to ARC Math022 tutoring and his office hours were helpful. This class gets a lot of negative reviews because a lot of people don't go out of their way to advocate for themselves and expect a good grade to just be handed without putting in the work. If you are willing to put in extra work and all the homework/study guides, go to tutoring/office hours---this class is extremely manageable. 	7	3/18/2022
		Professor Curtis is the only professor for this class. I honestly believe that he is a very fair teacher and he genuinely wants his students to understand the material and succeed. As someone who has not taken a calc class before, I had to make sure I worked hard and understood everything from the previous lecture before each new lecture. Homework can be time consuming, but it is really not bad. Make sure to give yourself enough time to complete each homework assignment so you don't stress about it the night it is due! Also, attend office hours, discussion TAs and Curtis holds really helpful ones. There are 2 midterms and 1 final. Midterms are about 16% and final is 32% of your grade. He gives several free points on each test depending on how well the class does overall. Math 22 is a bit easier than typical calc classes because it does not go too in depth in any topic and there's no trig. However, there will be useful business application problems. It was not too difficult if you advocate for yourself and put in the work to succeed. I was nervous for this class, but it ended up being my best class experience and I ended up with a grade I am proud of. 	6	12/22/2022
MATH031	4.30	Just do the homework and the quizzes, and the exams aren't too difficult. Had a great TA, Matt O'Dell. Helped tremendously. Professor would tell him to give us a quiz, and he would, but everyone failed, so he allowed us to take it home and redo it. Projects aren't too difficult, just show decent effort and you'll get a 100%	1	3/28/2017
		Just attend discussions; lectures are basically optional. 	1	6/19/2018
		Took this class for math minor. Midterm (mainly computational) was easy but later half of the course had alot of theory and conceptual stuff. Avoid Prof Rush, gives raw score of a B to a C, which doesn't make any sense...	9	4/22/2019
		Easy class, homework is online and takes about 20 minutes to do. The tests are just like the sample tests and the only mildly challenging test was the final.	1	4/22/2019
		I had Schmidt, Karl and he didn't really provide with anything online (iLearn). You have to go to his lecture because you won't have any notes or material (except the textbook if you find it online). His lecture is constant writing; all of the theorems and definitions. A big portion of his midterm is like true and false question and an explanation instead of solving it.	8	6/3/2019
		Discussion twice a week. The math itself isn't that hard but you have to justify your answer for some exam questions which requires knowing some theorems and what things actually mean rather than just memorizing a formula. This kinda messed a lot of people up. Quizzes weekly like every other math class, homework is online so you have to buy a subscription. 	4	6/15/2019
		Easy material, hard tests	6	6/18/2019
		Took it with Samuelson, midterm was easy since the midterm practice was similar. Was told final would be similar to the practice final. There were 5 questions out of 13 that we never covered in the final practice or in discussion. 	6	12/14/2019
		Do NOT take it with Samuelson. While he is a knowledgeable in the subject he's a very bland lecturer. The midterm wasn't too bad but there were at least 4-5 questions that were not previously discussed on the final. Take it with someone else and it shouldn't be difficult. 	8	12/22/2019
		Ziv Rav is a smart guy if you understand his lectures. Teaches the class conceptually (keep in mind), but his midterm/ final are easy AS LONG AS YOU GO TO CLASS. You don't have to pay attention; the textbook is already good enough to teach you, but he does tell you what kinds of questions will be on the midterm/final exam. He will provide practice midterm/final, but only 60-70% of the questions on there will be similar on the actual midterm/final; the other 40-30% is from when he tells you in lecture. Homework was on MatLab, very easy to do. Easy class, just show up to class 	4	12/25/2019
		Class is very easy, the midterm is a carbon copy of the sample except a couple of numbers are changed. As long as you do the homework and go to discussion you should be fine.	3	1/11/2020
		Very chill overall	3	5/27/2020
		[COVID-19 ERA] MATH031 wasn't too bad, tests not proctored only, use internet -> easy A. Final was made optional due to #BLM protests.	5	6/11/2020
		I had professor Yunied. He was alright in my opinion. I usually just go to the TA for more help since I thought she was more clear in teaching the material. Exams were usually only about 3-5 questions. So many theorems to know. But it's not that bad if you truly understand the proofs. Ended up with an A in the class just by completing all the homework and getting an A on the one midterm. 	7	6/17/2020
		Easy class, material learned in this is not very hard	3	8/10/2020
		Take Professor Samuelson's class if you can. I had him fall 2020 and he was very understanding of the whole online schooling situation as our grade was only based on matlab and written homework. Highly recommend	2	2/23/2021
		I took this class with Xin Yang and I gotta say, this class was too easy. It's hard to fail this class unless you consciously avoid doing the work. He makes the practice quizzes, midterm, and final identical to the real ones. Because of this, there was no need to attend lecture or discussions, which aren't mandatory.	1	3/19/2021
		Took the class with prof Xin yang and he was amazing!! He thoroughly taught the subject, and always made sure we understood. He always encourages students to email him questions or attend office hours and is very kind. His sample midterm and final is almost identical to the real midterm and final. Take his class, it’s an easy A!! 	3	3/21/2021
		I had this with Patricio Candela. This class is not the standard math class where you calculate stuff. It is more focused on theorems and T/F questions. If you want an A in this class, be prepared to study and memorize all the theorems. The calculation part is the easy part so don't focus too much on those. Be prepared to pay $60 for mymathlab.	6	3/28/2021
		(Fall 2021 - in person) Professor Samuelson was unbelievably lenient this quarter due to covid. The class was set up to be MyLab hw (40%), problem sets (20%), midterm (20%), and final (20%).  MyLab homework was pretty easy (I got 100%) and problem sets were okay (some questions can be found online).  He made it where if you missed a midterm or final, nothing will happen to you.  I got a 62% on the midterm and didn't even show up for the final, ended up with a B. 	7	12/20/2021
MATH046	4.14	Easy math class. Don't underestimate final 	5	3/31/2017
		Literally everyone else I have talked to said this class was super easy, it was one of the hardest maths I have taken. Avoid Daniel Guan at ALL COSTS.	5	12/26/2017
		The class as a whole is fairly simple. The midterm average was a 90% for all three sections. Nonetheless, the final was a bit more difficult compared to the midterm, so do not underestimate it.	3	3/24/2018
		Extremely easy class until the last chapter. Written homework and quizzes are worded odd and semi-ambiguous on what they ask. Take Zhixian Zhu as she has a clear passion for teaching and will go over step-by-step on difficult problems. 	4	3/28/2018
		Relatively easy and straightforward math class as long as you know your calculus fundamentals i.e. techniques of integration and derivatives. 	3	6/15/2018
		Had Diaz. Exams were generally like his quizzes and HW, nothing like his lectures (bc he made-up the problems as he lectured).Very simple. Mainly integration and derivatives.	2	7/10/2018
		This class was pretty hard for me, mostly because I couldn't wrap my head around the processes behind it. Read the book, Schaum's Outlines of Differentials is well written and helps out a lot if your professor sucks.	9	12/16/2018
		Yunied sucks tbh. Makes everything harder than it needs to be because it “stimulates” his brain	8	12/17/2018
		If you don't get an A, you either made some really dumb mistakes along the way or you need to reevaluate how you tackle college courses. As a UC transfer, this course was tied with the easiest course I have ever taken. 	2	12/18/2018
		Super easy class with Zhixian Zhu! Recommend this professor. Material was a bit intimidating at first, but gets easy once you get the hang of the class. The averages for the final and midterm were a high B.	3	3/25/2019
		Take Qixuan Wang. Written HW is graded by completion, midterm and final were only 4 problems and she tells you what will be on them. There is webwork most weeks but they only have a handful of problems (and the worst 2 are dropped). Posts slides but doesn't include solution to examples, which doesn't really matter because the material itself is very easy. You would have to actually try if you wanted to fail.	2	5/9/2019
		I had Savanna Gee, and she has been my favorite professor at UCR so far (after 4 quarters). She makes the content very easy to understand. Just take the lessons one day at a time, do some practice, and you'll get 100% on the final. If you want to get ahead, look over Linear, Bernoulli, Exact, & Homogeneous differential equations. If you haven't taken Linear Algebra, you gotta understand the Wronskian.	2	10/8/2020
		I took the class with Scott Atkinson, and I thought that the class was relatively difficult considering the fact that I did not take calculus for 2 years. It was difficult to get concepts at first. I had to do several problems from the book in addition to doing the online homework. Do not underestimate the midterm and final.	5	12/19/2020
		Had PoNing. Make sure to study for inexact differential equations, cauchy euler differential equations, mixing word problems, and newton's law of cooling as these are the hardest concepts in the class. Overall, class wasn't too difficult.	3	1/1/2021
		Took it with Weitao Chen - avoid at all costs. She made it all way harder then it needed to be, not finishing examples or not showing examples of a strategy to solve in the first place. Your grade is dependent on 2 midterms (both that are one question) and the final (which is 40% of your grade). Textbook isn't helpful, homework program is TERRIBLE. Good luck.	10	11/18/2021
		Took it with a grad student as lecturer (Kevin Tsai). He was good, class was easy, textbook wasn't necessary for me I just used lectures, took notes, did homework, reviewed for finals, and ended up with an A+. Just don't skip lectures and pay attention.	2	12/18/2021
		"I took this class with Hassan Attarchi in the Summer of 2022. Since this is a lower division course, it's not too difficult. For this class, the professor focused on 1 midterm, 1 final, and 2 quizzes. There weren’t any practice exams, but they weren’t too difficult in the first place. I found that the second half of the class is easier than the first, just because you're more used to the content. He also uses a modified grading scale, so the class is naturally curved. Do well on the exams and you’ll be fine. I finished the class with an A+. 
"	4	7/24/2022
MATH111	See CS111			
MATH120	5.00	Optimization: Taken with Ali Pakzad.  Midterm was very easy.  Did not go to class once after the midterm and still ended up with an A-.  Just do the practice problems on the notes and HW and you should be fine.	4	6/18/2019
		Professor Tucker taught the class pretty well. Has a standard grading system, so no curves but that already tells you that the class is easy. Provides practice midterm and final prior to the test which are identical. Discussion worksheets = easy true and false. Homeworks are tedious, but they help with your learning. 	4	6/8/2020
		(covid era) Took it with Henry Tucker. I hated this class, didn't understand anything. Somehow got an A+	8	9/15/2020
MATH121	5.00	Had Zhanar Berikkyzy. Class wasn't that difficult, and the professor also had policies like being able to bring a note card in for the final or earning up to 50% of points lost for the midterm if you correct your incorrect problems. Homework was pretty easy since the TA usually ended up going over the questions during discussions. The actual material wasn't too bad if you just read your notes and textbook and understand the homework.	5	3/26/2018
		Taken with Zhanar.  Pretty easy class, quizzes are taken in groups. Final replaces midterm, and she offers extra credit opportunities during lecture, up to 8% extra credit towards your final grade.  Some of her final exam problems were exactly the same as the practice final she gave out.	3	6/18/2019
		I took this course with Matthew Harper in the Winter of 2023. This class was a roller coaster for a lot of students. The professor went over a ton of content during lectures but he wouldn’t fully explain a lot of important topics, leading to a ton of confusion. The homework for this class was very difficult, and the TA that we had was no help. She never communicated with the professor, and she didn’t even understand what the class topic was about. Everyone failed the midterm so he let us do a re-take. The final was much more straightforward. Somehow, I ended the class with an A+. 	7	4/3/2023
MATH126	6.33	"Kevin Costello. Good guy. The homework is due usually once per week, on Wednesdays. Discussion was held on Tuesday, the day before the hw was due, which was a big help due to the TA going over homework problems. The content itself wasn't too bad. Starts with graphs, and goes into probability. The first half of the course is easy enough, mainly graph theory and the like. The second part was slightly more difficult imo, due to the types of problems introduced. There were two midterms and one final exam. When i took the course, we were allowed one sided ""cheat sheet"" for both midterms. The final allowed a double sided sheet. All in all difficulty wise, a pretty average upper division math course. Not terribly difficult, but still can be challenging. Grade received: B"	7	6/28/2017
		This class goes over graphs and counting things (inclusion-exclusion, Catalan numbers, generating functions, etc.). There was a homework assignment every week. Many problems consisted of proving things, but they were quite simple. There was a midterm and a final, both of which were doable. Go to office hours if you need help.	5	6/21/2020
		I had Henry Tucker as my professor. He made midterm and final available all day so that was a huge plus, worth 20% each. Too many problems on the homework and I couldn't do a lot of them on my own without trying to find the answers online or getting help from the TA as the lecture notes weren't very helpful. Also has a group project worth 20% where we recorded our own presentation on a math concept we learned in class. Then discussion worksheets were 20% which were a lot easier than homework. Honestly surprised I ended with a B so I guess I'm happy for that. 	7	6/21/2021
MATH131	7.75	Taken with Professor Xu. It's the first proof-based class I and many other students have taken. It's very abstract and conceptual, just very different from lower division maths. CS011/MATH011 is a good course to prepare or reinforce the type of concepts for 131.	9	6/16/2018
		Zhu is a great professor, it's hard to teach Math131 in general. Curved the class very generously, as long as you do well on your homeworks (i.e. All A's on each homework and a B on the midterm), you are on track for an A in the class.	8	6/8/2020
		Had the class with Javier Gonzalez, excellent instructor. The material itself is not hard but it is a proof based class so sometimes it can be tricky to fully justify and understand certain concepts. Lectures and discussions were very useful and I would highly recommend office hours, they are very helpful for the homework. We had 6 homework assignments, 6 quizzes (lowest quiz dropped), 2 midterms and a final. Midterms were very fair and as long as you do understand the hw you should at least get 80%, only a small portion of it was tricky. The exam was cumulative so it was a little harder, but still extremely fair. I did well on the hw and quizzes and averaged about 80% for the exams which gave me an 85% for the class which was an A-.	6	3/22/2021
MATH132	9.20	I took Math132 with Professor Gindi. I've had him for 3 classes so far and he is a great professor but he and his TA's have graded super strict for every class I've had him with. 132 is 2nd level linear algebra and the material is fairly abstract and somewhat dense. Spend a lot of time studying and truly understanding the concepts. The midterm and final did not have a practice test but were mostly based on in class examples and homework problems (Gindi has done this for all of his classes)	8	3/28/2018
		If you don't have a good grasp of Linear Algebra it'll be really tough.	9	6/16/2019
		Taken with Xiao Xinli.  Barely passed, was completely lost the whole quarter but the curve was very generous.  Midterm and Final averages were below 50%.	10	6/18/2019
		I got an A+ in 131 and still struggled with this class. Took with professor Gan online and let me tell you, this class was HARD. I don't know where he was getting his problems from but there were zero similar examples to be found anywhere. His homework and exams were open everything (even internet) as long as you did not discuss with others on exams. His office hours were helpful too but it was still hard as hell. I studied the book religiously. I've had him before and he was great but this class was on a whole different level.	10	9/15/2020
MATH133	5.00	I had Professor Lihan, the class was heavy on proofs, the homework was more difficult than the exams. There was a presentation on topology topics (which was on material beyond the scope of this class). Overall average difficulty for upper division math course	7	4/4/2017
		Fall20 with Schultz. As with any class taught by Schultz, I didn't pay attention to lectures, never really read through his material, still got an A. You can get through the first half knowing hs geometry, the second half introduced a few new things but nothing terrible. 3 quizzes, 2 exams, the Schultz usual.	3	12/30/2020
MATH135A	5.63	Numerical Analysis, with Dr. Lizheng Tao. Pretty general upper-div class. Requires the use of matlab though. If you are unfamiliar, just go to the TA's office hours and they'll guide you through the installation of the software. There was only one coding project though, and it's literally just translate the pseudocode from the textbook into matlab. Quizzes we had 5 with lowest dropped. Homeworks we had about the same amount. Homeworks weren't too bad. The class itself was ok, lectures I pretty much ignored. The concepts however weren't too difficult, as long as you went to discussion and/or looked online at practice problems.	6	12/13/2017
		As long as you can memorize algorithms, the class is ALL plug and CHUG. 	1	12/19/2017
		Had Lizheng Tao. Lectures weren't really that useful, but exams were mostly very similar to the practice tests, and the book was easy enough to understand. Class was basically just remembering algorithms and formulas and then plugging in the numbers. My class only had one programming assignment, but if all you need to do is implement an algorithm, you could probably just take the pseudocode directly from the book except change it to MATLAB syntax obviously, and it should work. Class wasn't that difficult overall, but it can be tedious with the computation if the numbers aren't nice.	5	12/20/2017
		Took it when Weitao Chen. Didn’t really go to lecture. Was able to get by with just discussion. Just memorize formulas. There’s a little bit of coding but nothing too bad. 	5	12/17/2018
		Not bad. Just need to memorise some formulas.	4	12/18/2018
		Material is pretty hard in general, projects and homework are tough. Midterm and final was mostly homework problems. 	9	1/12/2019
		Song is a boring professor. Very monotoned, speeds through a bunch of useless examples. Programming projects were annoying as the pseudocode in the textbook were poorly explained; Song didn't teach us how to read it. 1st half of the class seemed like a smooth/ easy ride. 2nd half was a complete 180. HW became very difficult and so was the final. Made students feel dumb as well. 	8	12/22/2020
		This class is not easy nor hard. However, the exams are a time clutch. You need to know how to solve each question in a quick time frame or you won’t be able to double check or even finish the exam. 	7	12/28/2020
MATH135B	5.00	Took the class with Weitao Chen. 135B is a continuation of 135A, and I'd say that the difficulty of the material in 135B wasn't really any harder or easier than in 135A. I ended up just reading the book and going to discussions instead of going to lecture and was fine. Chen's programming assignments were more difficult, but you'll have around two weeks to do them, so you should be fine if you start early and go to office hours for help. Exams were fair if you understood the homework.	4	3/26/2018
MATH136	5.00	Math136 is number theory and I took is with professor Livesay. Even though it was his first time teaching number theory, he did an excellent job and I found myself truly enjoying the class. Homework assignments are lengthy but not too difficult and graded fairly. Make sure you know both your proofs and calculations and you should end up doing very well on the midterm and final. 	6	3/28/2018
MATH144	7.00	Math144 is set theory. I took it with Brian Benson who is very enthusiastic and passionate about the class. The material itself starts off not too bad but in my experience quickly became very abstract and difficult to understand. Homework, midterm, and final were all graded pretty strictly but the curve is generous. All around, a decently hard class	7	3/28/2018
		This is basically supposed to be an intro to proofs class. Took it with Schultz. He doesn't use ilearn but instead uploads files to a directory which you have to check regularly since you aren't notified when he adds something new. Lectures were hard to sit through. Honestly I relied on my TA to get me through this class, he did a very good job of explaining the material. Schultz would post a lot of practice problems which I would then go ask the TA how to do them. We were graded on a midterm, 3 quizzes, and a final. Big curves, 64-84 was a B on his midterm lol. I think Math/cs011 would be good prep for this class.	6	12/12/2019
MATH145A	9.00			
MATH145B	8.00	I think this class was difficult just because it's Topology. It's a confusing course. I took 145A with Schultz, and while he's a bright man, his teaching style doesn't help me learn Topology. So, I took 145B with Atkinson. He's a pretty organized and good professor, and he had a good TA too so that helped me SOMEWHAT understand things. However, if you can avoid Topology in general, I would.	8	6/8/2020
MATH146A	3.25	Math 146A is Ordinary Differential Equations and mostly covers slightly more intricate problems as compared to Math046. IMO the class was straight forward and the tests were not too difficult although the HW can be time consuming.	4	8/23/2018
		Eeaaasy. Took it with Moradifam. As long as you do the hw yourself you should be able to pass the exams. Some of the exam questions were exactly the same as hw problems. He gives a certain number of problems in exams and you can choose one to not answer. No quizzes. The first half is basically the end of math031 again, just finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. Second half is a bit new, you have to draw phase portraits which seems daunting at first but it really isn't that bad if you have the right professor explain it to you. I'm not sure if exams were curved bc some people got perfect scores on the midterm but if you do better on the final he'll drop your midterm. He really just wants students to pass.	2	12/12/2019
		Feng Xu is a terrible professor: doesn't reply to emails, recommends you to drop the class without helping you, no way to cushion your grade. 40% midterm, 60% final, no curve. Though he goes through SIMILAR examples that will be on the midterm/final, but only SIMILAR examples, not exact type of questions. TA carried the course, but he doesn't really care about his students. Very inaccessible.  	4	12/22/2020
		I took this course with James Kelliher in the Fall of 2022. This class was one of the easiest math courses I’ve taken at UCR. There is 1 midterm and 1 final and both have practice tests that are very similar to the exam. There is homework, but it was not graded, so it wasn’t really necessary. There are also weekly quizzes in discussion, but the TA pretty much went over similar problems before each quiz. Despite skipping the last 3 weeks of lecture, I still finished the class with an A. 	3	12/13/2022
MATH146B	3.50			
MATH146C	8.00	Math146C is Partial Differential Equations, this course unlike parts A and B can be quite challenging. Understanding the method for separation of variables and the Sturm-Liouville problem are essentials. It also wouldn't hurt to know some Fourier analysis as some PDE's can only be solved in such a manner. All in all the class will test your abilities and the test's won't be a walk in the park like parts A and B.	8	8/23/2018
MATH147	10.00	Math147 is Fourier Analysis and true to its name is a pure analysis course. Dr. Lapidus often teaches the course as an elective and thus effort will often be rewarded with a minimum of a B+. In order to truly understand the course would require a solid year or so of graduate level analysis so his grading is pretty laid back. Quizzes and a group project make up a solid percentage of your grade so no need to fret. He assigns HW often but you probably only turn in two packets at most, but the HW is on par with ripping teeth out of your skull with pliers. Its tough to do and will leave you with a massive headache after attempting and failing at the same proof of convergence in L2 space. Pay attention, ask questions, and above all do not bullshit on your project. The man is not afraid to tear you a new in front of your peers and has a in depth knowledge of physics as well as math so he will call you out. Still a fun elective to take if you're up for a challenge.	10	8/23/2018
MATH148	7.00	I had this class with Michel Lapidus. Our grade was based on attendance and participation (15%, half-half), homework (40%), and a project (45%). Luckily, there were no quizzes or tests; I had no idea what was being taught. There were 2 homeworks. They were made up of problems from the book and problems he gave during lecture and we weren't required to do all of them. We had the option of doing the project in a group or individually (I was in a group). The professor barely gave us any idea what to do on it. He said a presentation is usually mandatory but because all this took place during the pandemic, the presentation was extra credit. Be sure to take notes during lecture because he doesn't post his online. Also, I went to every lecture and discussion but apparently that wasn't enough to get full points for attendance and participation. My final grade was a B. I decided to take this class because I wanted to learn something new, but I was left disappointed. I would not recommend taking this class with this professor.	7	6/21/2020
MATH149A	5.00	The homework was a lot more difficult than the tests, but Dr. Costello provides you with practice tests from previous years that really help you prepare. The most difficult material for me was the probability. 	5	12/19/2017
MATH151A	8.00	Fall20 with Dr. Gavosto (awesome professor). No exams. Weekly hw assignments, every other week we would have an additional assignment worth more points, kept you very busy. Some extra credit opportunities. Knowing latex beforehand would help. Basically proving stuff in calculus starting from the basics and building your way up.	8	12/30/2020
MATH153	3.00	This class was really easy when you take it with Schultz. ALTHOUGH, I took it as a fully online course (hello COVID-19 pandemic). He literally gives you everything you need to do well! Also, the content was pretty interesting. I think it could be difficult as an in-person course, but not really. It kind of helps to take MATH136, because some of the concepts are brought up again in MATH153. Overall, I liked this class.	3	6/8/2020
MATH165A	7.50	Math165A is Complex Variables and IMO is relatively straight forward. If you are good with calculus and good with complex numbers, then this class should be cake walk. The theorems are not to tough to prove but the HW out of the Brown/Churchill book can be a bit of a pain. Test are straight forward and are often mostly application instead of proof.	6	8/23/2018
		James Kheiller is a very poor professor. The man cannot teach math for his life. He is passionate, but he sucks at explaining the concepts. He grades the homework very harshly! Beware! If you can't follow with him, or follow his method, he will deduct massive points. 	9	6/8/2020
MATH165B	8.00	Math165B is the second portion to complex variables. Unlike in part A, 165B offers a bit more intricacy when it comes to the proofs, more often then not they are non-trivial integrals over contours which require some sneaky substitutions and a decent ability to solve integrals. Much like 165A, the HW is still tedious and full of repetitive calculations and some tricky proof questions. Ideally one should have a decent grasp of 165A to do well for 165B.	8	8/23/2018
MATH168	2.00	Be prepared to do a lot of programming in Matlab. If you do all of your assignments on time, you should be able to get an A, it's really hard to get anything lower than an A. 	2	12/19/2017
MATH171	7.00	Took it with Dr. Yeakel. Things get pretty abstract. The class was hard and pretty time consuming but I thoroughly enjoyed it. We were graded on hw, worksheets, a midterm, and a final. Exams were proctored over zoom. Both the professor and TA were super helpful. Got an A+ (:	7	3/23/2021
MCBL121	6.25	Hsiao has pretty simple exams.  Watch out for his free response questions cuz they take longer than you might think.  Pretty fair for 50 mins and no cumulative final.  Uses TopHat for extra credit and assigned a powerpoint group presentation in discussion.  Very straightforward class overall.	4	12/17/2018
		Interesting class but Wenbo Ma had really hard exams & her TA was a super. She had the audacity to get mad at us when the average was mid 50s.. don't you know the common denominator between all of us is having YOU as a professor?	10	6/6/2020
		Most topics are not too difficult to understand as long as you pay attention and watch the lecture videos. There is a lot of content, so this class requires heavy memorization and there is some application type questions in the FRQ portion. The exams contain both MC and FRQ, so sometimes it is a bit of a time crunch to complete everything in 50 minutes. The class does require a lot of studying, but he also gives up to 100 points of extra credit (can boost your grade up to 10%) from extra credit quizzes and extra credit points awarded by the TA for the group presentations (and most people got full EC points for the presentations). People were worried about their grades based on the exams only, but the EC boosted most people by around 7-8%, so it helped big time and there was no curve needed I believe as the overall average was already around a solid B (based on calculations I did from Canvas averages).	7	3/24/2022
MCBL121L	4.00	Lab reports are easy but long and tedious, so don't make the same mistake I did and start late. Make sure you format them correctly. You can expect to pull an all-nighter if you start the night before. Coffey grades somewhat harshly on the scientific paper for some strange reason, so expect points off even if you show it to him and he gives the ok. The midterms are easy if you pay attention in class (no final). Go for the extra credit points!	4	6/22/2019
MCBL123	8.00	"Rao gave weird test questions and stuff that wasn't really mentioned in class/taught on the slides. Luckily, the last half of the class was taught by Dr. Morrison, who was much more straightforward in what she expected of us. The final was legitimately difficult. Rao doesn't give ""-"" final overall grades, so you could go from an A to a B+, B directly to a C+, etc. Definitely wouldn't recommend unless you want your ass kicked by a massive GPA dropper like this. Also, Rao likes to eat away at your grade with hard pop quizzes in lecture. Memorization is heavily tested in this course."	8	6/22/2019
MCBL125	5.00	Class based mostly on lab work--3 days a week. Prof and TA kinda unorganized but overall grading was extremely fair. There is a scientific paper on your lab work and a final presentation on personal research. These are due during week 10 so get ready for a major time crunch. Study slides for all tests and exams.	5	6/22/2019
MCBL126	3.50	Dr. Borneman is super nice and grades very fairly. This class tests common sense and knowledge (mostly) but the tests will get harder over time. There is memorization of class material tested on the 2nd midterm and final. There are also small assignments due throughout the quarter, so don't forget to turn them in! Everything you will need to know will be in his class slides! Very interesting and informative class.	3	6/22/2019
		Dr. Borneman has a review session before each exam, just study those slides and you'll be fine on every exam. Every question is true or false. Just understand what each paper is doing and why, you'll be fine. Easy class with medium effort put in. 	4	6/14/2022
MCBL133	7.00	Dr. Aronson is a very nice professor, and she is very enthusiastic about environmental microbiology. We had a take home final, a presentation, and two midterms. The grading was very lenient imo, but you have you pay attention to what she says in class because not all of what she says is on her slides.	7	4/1/2019
MCBL139	4.00	Really chill class and super interesting too! Dr. McFrederick and Natasha are very helpful. The grading is extremely fair--study guides are posted, and they are extremely helpful. Pay attention in class, and you'll get an A :)	4	12/30/2019
		Quinn McFrederick was an awesome and enthusiastic professor!. Going to class is important though, as the test questions are more of what he says verbally than on the slide. 2 midterms and a final. Small homework assignments. Study guides/topics extremely close to the exam. It more difficult because we touch on many broad concepts in different fields and read scientific articles in the discussion section but its fun and easier than other MCBL courses I have taken. 	4	2/4/2022
MCS001	5.50	Ruhi Khan was the professor and she has made an intro class pretty hard. There are a bunch of readings and she is so freaking opinionated and won't listen to anyone else's opinions. The midterms are not exactly that hard, but man that teacher is brutal. I don't recommend taking it with her, she makes everything so much complicated than it should be and when I went to office hours for a paper, the ta and the professor both said different things so it was extremely confusing. She complained for a whole class on how bad our essays were and  she grades pretty hard. 	8	11/21/2019
		Had Contreras. TBH the hardest part of the entire class was just the 3 hr lecture slot. Super boring but an easy A overall.	3	5/22/2021
MCS005	2.80	Any mcs class with Anderson is an easy A 	1	6/15/2019
		Half of the course content is a rehashing of MCS001 and the rest of the course content is media theories. Professor Su is flexible and understanding. Your grade is based on the midterm (multiple choice) and final (2 essay questions). The only downside of this course lectures arent reuploaded, but fairly simple class. 	4	12/28/2020
		Took with Anderson during Covid Winter 2021 and it was pretty easy. All lectures were prerecorded and discussions aren't mandatory. The lectures are kind of boring and long but would have probably been better in person. No final exam, but there's a final project which is making a blog. Do all of the lecture pps and only need to do 4 discussion pps for full pp credit. Easy A	2	3/29/2021
		I took it in Spring 2022 with Tabassum Khan. She is an okay professor. She rambles a lot during lecture, and depending on the TA you might do well enough. I had Brian Piche-Cifuentes, and he was understanding of students so he was a bit more lenient on how he graded our midterm and what was required in our final paper. He summarized the lectures that made it easier to understand since the professor would ramble about the readings. They expect you to do the reading prior to attending class because she would talk about then. She also posts the slides about the reading before class. There was a midterm, weekly discussion posts for the discussion section and 2 discussion posts for the actual class, and a final paper. However, the other TA, Mallory, had assigned additional things sometimes like a quiz. Overall it's not too bad if you can remember the terms and events in Media. The midterm is based on what was taught, whereas the final paper was on a topic assigned by the professor based on a recent event in media. I got a 69/100 on the midterm, but did well on the final paper so I passed with a B. 	6	6/22/2022
		Wendy Su is a good professor, as long as you are fast at taking notes and attend every lecture you will get at least a B. 	1	12/3/2022
MCS006	See ART006			
MCS010	4.00	attend review sessions before the midterm and final and you should be okay for the exams. 	2	3/31/2017
		Midterms are specific about the readings and lecture notes. Go to lecture, she (setsu) tells you what is going to be on the midterm. She seems nice but is kinda unapproachable because she judges you so hard. Rachel (TA) was the best!! she replied fast on emails, graded things on time, and created summaries for the readings (i read those summaries for midterms instead of doing the readings) 	6	12/15/2018
MCS015	2.00	Grade is determined on effort, bigger assignments are left optional but as long as you turn in all the assignments you will get an A, highly recommend if the class if with Sheryl Vint.	2	12/14/2021
MCS020	1.17	derek burrill. take the class 	1	4/1/2018
		Prof Burril is an excellent and cares about his students truly. Class isn't hard just need to watch 8 movies. The midterm and final was to choose a movie and write a review. which were really easy.	1	12/28/2020
		I had Professor Burrill for Fall 2020 online. The class was asynchronous, but the professor had office hours. Powerpoint lecture slides were lengthy. Only hw was watching a film each week. Midterms weren't proctored, and we had a generous amount of time to complete them. They were essays, and nearly everyone got A's. Don't try to take advantage of Professor Burrill's kindness. 	2	12/30/2020
		Took this class Fall 2022 with Prof. Burrill and it has been one of my favorite classes I've ever taken. Personally, not only was it an easy A, the material and professor made the class enjoyable. 	1	4/4/2023
MCS047	3.00	[COVID-19] Professor Jeong is an amazing professor with such passion for Korean film! Very easy breadth course. You watch films, answer weekly discussion questions, and take a multiple-choice weekly quiz. Lecture slides are asynchronous with no attendance or discussion section. She had only 5 live lectures that were recommended but not mandatory. 2 quite easy 1-2 page reaction papers to one film you enjoyed, she gives you all the resources needed to write it.	3	12/19/2020
MCS154	4.00	Setsu Shigematsu. Pretty easy class, one class and one screening per week. Lots of the class is student presentations. Points come from your journal, tests (easy, she tells you exactly what is on the tests), and presentations. Overall an interesting class with not too much effort required. Some of the readings can be a bit long though.	4	6/22/2019
ME002	9.00	ACTUALLY DO THE HOMEWORK. If you truly understand the concepts of the homework you'll breeze through the midterms. If you have Princevac be warned the final will be the factor that determines whether you pass the weeder course or not. 	8	3/31/2017
		"You cover the basics of the whole ME curriculum in this one class. Two midterms, one final. You need to do good on at least one midterm because the final ends up killing everyones grade. There is a class curve at the end, but you need to make sure you make the original cutoff for a passing grade. I had stahovich so the cutoff was a 62% for a C. The majority of the class does fail however. 

Homework will take a good 6-8 hours to complete, quizzes are really bad, and you're expected to spend the majority of your time on this class.

Stahovich was a good professor. "	9	7/9/2017
		This was probably the hardest class I have taken so far (entering 2nd year), so STUDY UP AND DONT SLACK. I barely made it through with a C, but most of my friends did not	10	9/17/2017
		Hands down the most difficult weedout course in engineering: they told us on day 1 that only a third of us were expected to get above a C (there is no curve for Princevac), 60% of my class failed. ME2 is designed to make you think like an engineer, not teach you material, which trips up a LOT of people... questions are based on “figure out how to solve the problem” instead of “plug numbers into an equation”. No equation sheets, majority symbolic (mass m1, etc) and only simple calculators, all about your ability to solve problems. If you’re into that, ME2 will be your favorite underclassman course; if not, join the 60%.	10	12/26/2017
		Material isn't particularly hard, there is just a lot of info that is covered and the test problems tend to be fairly complex. Your set up is more important than the actual calculations.	10	10/30/2018
		You are going to be surprised when you take this class in your first or second year because it take a lot more effort to get good grades than other lower div classes. It probably exists just to scare off students and make them feel ME is not right for them. I sure wish someone told me this class would be so disgusting beforehand because I was definitely not ready for it. 	10	7/14/2019
		"I took this class with Princevac. Class is difficult because of content and heavy emphasis on exam scores, only about 7 A's my year out of a class of 80+. Huge help if you take PHYS040B concurrently (a lot of the topics align such as buoyant forces, and efficiency).

What helped me the most to get an A is having access to 100% correct answers from Chegg or solution keys from previous years. Having accurate solutions helped in two ways: one, saved my homework grade and, two, gave me the right answers to study from when it came to the exam time. Midterm 1, 4/5 problems were seen previously in either homework or quizzes. Midterm 2, 3/5 problems were seen already. Go to office hours to check if your solutions are 100% correct, so you don't miss any points on the exam. Outside of his lectures, you should start applying the principles in the real world and think, ""what are the forces acting on this system?"" or ""Why does this work/built this way?"". Ultimately this class should start to make you think like an engineer. Keep in mind this class is supposed to be somewhat enjoyable, and stay humble because it only gets harder from here."	7	3/31/2020
		I took the class with Akula Venkatram for winter 2021. EXTREMELY ROUGH time, he knows his stuff, but horrible at teaching. Would act like a child with poor test scores, and doesn't seem to care about his students. But gave nice curve at the end. The homework did not reflect the quizzes and tests much, hes a very conceptual based professor.	9	5/14/2021
		Stahovich Summer 2022 Online: The class was pretty easy for the first half but definitely picks up albeit gradually. If you're comfortable with PHYS40A&B, MOST of the class will be review and straightforward. Homework takes awhile and is graded on correctness. It's possible to do it in a day, but not fun. Quizzes are fine as long as you understand the homework. First midterm was easy, second was harder, and the final was rough. Generally though, the exams are pretty similar to the homework, so there is no review material given before the exams. There is no bell curve, but the grade margins are shifted-- ex. 90% for an A, 86% for an A-. Just stay on top of everything and realize that this is class is not only to introduce you to ME, but to teach you the problem solving skills needed for the rest of the classes to come. 	6	8/24/2022
ME009	6.00	"CAD Assignments were ridiculously easy at first but slowly progressed in difficulty. You also take the CSWA Exam at the end of the quarter and only 40% of my class passed the exam (which is apparently normal according to the professor).
Honestly, if you just read the textbook and do well on the CAD Assignments (CAD is 40% of your grade), you'll be fine."	5	6/15/2018
		Took with Sawyer. The class itself was relatively easy. You should be fine as long as you do the CAD assignments and the homework. When he does examples in SolidWorks in class, it'll be hard to keep up with him at first, but it should become easier over time. The questions on the Midterm and Final were almost identical and looked like it turned the textbook readings into questions themselves. Okay class overall.	4	12/19/2019
		CADS is 40% of your grade, always do them and make sure there's annotation. TA grades super harsh, if you make one small mistake, you get 1/3 to even more than half the credits off your assignments/midterm/CAD. I had to take it as a first year student, with 0 experiences in Engineering because of block, I had so much trouble and everything feels like there is suppose to be a prerequisite class.	9	11/24/2020
ME010	6.75	"Im a CE major, took the class for the ""other"" engineering requirement
if you dont want to go into ME or you didnt do too well in physics then this class will be HARD otherwise you should be fine"	8	8/24/2018
		I'm an MSE and this class was a struggle. I pushed all of my other classes to the side for this class. Tons of time put in outside of class to understand the concepts that Stahovich zooms through in lecture. If you love ME, physics, and have a good understanding of MATH010A ahead of time, you'll be fine.	10	3/27/2019
		Prof. Eskandari taught the class very well. HW were easy, quizzes were her lecture notes. 2 Midterms; midterms represented of homework problems and lecture example problems. Final were problems from practice final. Every time she says hint hint or wink wink, that's an indication you'll see that problem either on a quiz, midterm, or final. Take her hints seriously if you want an A. Also go to her office hours for extra credit. Great professor	2	6/8/2020
		"Taken with Dinsmore (Cal Poly) because no other professor wanted to teach this class. Professor had very specific, annoying guidelines for homework. Uses physics free-body diagrams and trigonometry. I've been able to get by with discussion and homeworks. Definitely feel my time would've been better spent in another ""in-engineering"" class."	7	5/24/2022
ME018A	7.50	Difficult if you have no coding experience whatsoever but you do get used to the syntax as the quarter progresses. Attend the labs and ask the TAs for any questions as that's apparently your substitution for office hours. Don't slack off on the final as it was pretty difficult if you don't review for it. It was a mix of hand calculations and writing code by hand. There was a design project due at the end of the quarter. It was pretty difficult so start early. While it is something you can do in 3 days, it is not worth the stress.	7	12/21/2018
		Many MEs hate coding or have no experience with it, and ME18 (Intro to MatLab) isn’t meant to teach those skills. Thus, if you come in hoping to touch MatLab as little as possible, or are playing catchup with coding, good luck... best to study ahead by learning Python (lots of great tutorials online) as the syntax has a number of similarities. Sawyer is a babe, but he means it when he says to start the design project early: it’s pretty complex and will devastate novice programmers. Beyond that barrier, ME18 is a chill A :)	7	12/26/2017
		I had Dr. Tom Stahovich for this class. He barely answered questions and his assignments were littered with mistakes. I have never been more irritated with a class. Lab assignments took hours. No exams besides the final (which was optional in the end). He had intended to have a half paper half matlab exam and was only stopped from doing that because students didn’t have printers to use. Strongly recommend taking someone else for this class. I learned nothing from him just figured things out on my own and with the TA’s help. 	8	6/7/2020
		"Took it with Venkatram aka ""Venky"" Fall 2020. Transfer students with no coding experience / MATLAB experience beware, he will expect you to teach yourself coding. His grading system is whack. The TA and other students are teaching the class at this point. No one knows how he grades the labs. However, if you are good at math/manipulating physics equations, and know coding, it's an easy A. "	4	12/10/2020
		ME18A introduces coding in MATLAB. It gets very difficult after week 2 if you don’t know anything about coding beforehand. They say you don’t need to know how to code but most students who are in the class understand a fair amount before taking the course but if you don’t know a single bit, it is better to learn about MATLAB before taking this course.	9	12/15/2021
		"ME 018A is also called Intro to MATLAB or Engineering Computation. It's supposed to teach engineers the ""basics of MATLAB"" and is a ""introduction to programming"". It is not an intro class and the level of programming is intermediate to advanced. Learn Python before taking this class.

Coding labs will suck out so much time in your schedule. You'll think the first lab is easy and it's alright, pretty straightforward, but it climbs in difficulty. For example, you have to program recursive sequences without being taught what is recursion. Note that you cant use in-built tools on MATLAB and you have to create these tools through code.

Pray you'll pass the class if Sundar or Stahovich is teaching it. Hardest engineering class I've taken at this school. I took the class with Sundar teaching.

Sundar lectures decently, but his exams, coding assignments, coding final, was on a whole different level. When it came to coding for the labs and projects he would concoct the most insanely difficult assignment to do. Sundar will work you into the ground if you want to succeed in not just this class, but any ME class he teaches.

I believe that Sundar does care to some degree but he is incredibly harsh when it comes to grading. Often he doesn't reply to emails. Honestly even stressful talking to him."	10	4/7/2023
ME018B	8.43	Took it the first time the class was being offered. ME018 was split into 18A and 18B beginning Fall 2018. This class involves a lot of theorem. You really need to understand the theorem, not just the formulas, or you will fail the class. You will have homework every week -- do not slack off on these. The homework will help you understand the material on the exams (2 midterms and 1 final). There are also quizzes almost every week in discussion. In addition, there was a project due at the end of the quarter. Start the project early cause it's something you can not procrastinate. In fact, a majority of the class didn't finish the project. Class had a huge curve at the end but I'm guessing it was because we were the first ones to take it so be wary. There may not be any more curves for future classes.	10	12/21/2018
		There's no official textbook for the class, but looking into some dynamics and fluid mechanics books will certainly be helpful. If taking this with professor Sundarajan, beware of a LOT of homework. Our first midterm had a 50% average score.	8	12/25/2018
		Many MEs hate coding or have no experience with it, and ME18 (Intro to MatLab) isn’t meant to teach those skills. Thus, if you come in hoping to touch MatLab as little as possible, or are playing catchup with coding, good luck... best to study ahead by learning Python (lots of great tutorials online) as the syntax has a number of similarities. Sawyer is a babe, but he means it when he says to start the design project early: it’s pretty complex and will devastate novice programmers. Beyond that barrier, ME18 is a chill A :)	7	12/26/2017
		Sundar literally combines every engineering topic into this course (heat transfer, fluids, mechanics, statics, etc). You need an extremely strong math foundation going in and good work ethics if you want to pass. Sundar is extremely hard but will make one hell of an engineer out of you.	10	12/14/2019
		Taken with Professor Sundar. Ignored all of my classes and put all of my focus on this class. I didn't think it was too bad, and it would have been worse in person. Still a really difficult class though.	10	12/16/2020
		barely felt like I was passing tests and understanding how to apply concepts correctly throughout, came out with a B+ somehow. Center of mass, forward/inverse kinematics, MATLAB, and other concepts are hurled at you rapid fire, be sure to utilize all available resources for this class (TA, discussion, other students, study groups, discord, HW help sites)	8	12/21/2021
		"There is a project for this class and I recommend starting it early as possible.

Class appears to be pre-curved.
"	6	4/7/2023
ME103	7.00	No midterm only, quizzes and final. Hw 20% quiz 30% and final 50%. Professor Xu is funny and all, but he doesnt really know how to teach 	7	3/16/2020
ME100A	6.00	Study early! There are only 2 laws you need to know but there are hundreds of ways to use them. Do as many practice problems as possible!	9	3/28/2018
		"This class was one of my easiest ME courses so far (would give a 2.5 difficulty), probably because I took it with Professor ChenLi (Fall Quarter). His class is generously curved and he is a rather good professor. Some might have trouble understanding him due to his Chinese accent. Discussions are optional and I attended only one. To excel in his class: (1) attend every lecture and take THOROUGH notes, (2) allocate some time to study in a small group or to self-study, and (3) actually try to understand the material, even by studying homework solutions while doing the ""optional"" homework. "	2	8/24/2018
		Took it with Sinisa Coh. Easiest ME class I've taken in UCR. Material is difficult but Coh really makes things easy to understand. Make sure to go to class.	2	12/11/2019
ME110	7.33	Professor Eskandari is an amazing professor. She will put more focus on learning than grades. Exams are very fair but beware of pop quizzes.	7	12/14/2019
		*if you see a review for ME114 but it says Eskandari in the review, i meant for it to say ME110. Sorry about that.	7	12/30/2019
		Kumar went super easy on the first midterm and then made the second one deadly hard. The final was horribly difficult but the average was so terrible that the curve was immense. Just try your best and at least stay average with the rest of the people in the class. He also gives pop quizzes so pro tip if you plan on not going: go to every lecture and stand outside to see if there is one lol	8	5/17/2020
		Professor DInsmore is a joke. He does not listen nor respond to any of his students' concerns regarding grading for the class. The average for the midterm was a low F and he was not willing to curve the midterm nor change the grading scale for the course. The only piece of information he gave was to do better on the final because it can replace the midterm, leaving the final to be 95% of the grade for the majority of the class... Be prepared to teach yourself the material. He doesn't respond to his emails in a timely manner and gives extremely short notice for exams. It become impossible to reach out to him and it's gotten so bad that I had to reach out to our faculty advisor Professor Sundar to speak with him just so that his students' concerns reach him. I would avoid him at all costs if possible	10	11/22/2021
		Professor Dinsmore covered the material very broadly, making it so that we had to learn from the homework and from Youtube on our own time. He decided to curve at the end probably due to pressure from the students and administration. Otherwise, the material and concepts learned through this class are actually pretty fun. 	5	12/20/2021
ME113	6.33	I took this course with Professor Martinez, and it ended up as one of the hardest classes I have ever taken during the first half of the quarter. I believe the class was difficult because the TA's teachings were inconsistent with that of the professor's, so there was a lot of confusion. The professor's office hours are extremely helpful and she actually is a good professor. She's new so she's still testing the waters regarding grading and structure. Overall the class was challenging, but it was a good experience. 	8	8/24/2018
		Took this class with Professor Dinsmore, wasn't bad at all. He gets kinda side tracked sometimes and the hw can be pretty long. Just study the hw before each quiz and you should be fine. Go to every discussion because he doesn't say when the quizzes will be.	4	1/20/2020
		Took it with Aguilar, great guy. Although for the midterm and final he says that he pulls questions from homeworks and lecture problems, but he doesn't. 	7	3/16/2020
ME114	4.33	I had Kumar for this class, do your work an you should get an A. Fairly easy concepts. 	3	8/26/2018
		Took it with Professor Eskandari. She is an amazing professor and will explain all the concepts thoroughly. The only downside is that she loves giving pop quizzes.	7	12/30/2019
		Took with Professor Ozkan. Super easy if you remember basic chemistry. Extra easy if you took CEE135. I never went to lecture and just reviewed his slides before exams and it went fine. Very fun concepts.	3	5/17/2020
ME118	8.75	The math can be very challenging and hard to grasp at first. You need to study. Matlab is important but barely relevant to final grade. 	8	8/26/2018
		A lot of math, linear algebra and differential equations. I took it with sundar, he expects us to do 2 projects, but doesnt really go over them 	8	3/16/2020
		Took it with Sundar. He writes very fast. Excellent professor. Assigns a lot of hw. Exams and project pretty intense.	10	3/19/2021
ME120	8.60	Avoid Luat Vuong at all costs	10	3/23/2019
		Extremely difficult with Sundar. He breezes through lecture and his notes/HW solutions are super sloppy. He skips a lot of steps in his HW solutions making it not that helpful. Definitely read the book for the class.	10	12/11/2019
		One midterm, two projects. Took it with Sundar. Overall, this class was difficult but if you do the homeworks/review the quizzes, you will be fine.	8	12/30/2019
		Avoid professor Vuong! Shes a great helpful person, but teaching isn't really for her.	9	3/16/2020
		LTV isn't bad, but book and lecture are teach differently. Office hours are helpful	6	4/6/2021
ME135	10.00	Absolute Pain in the clASS. 30%quizzes, 30% midterm, 40% final. Venky takes textbooks problems and creates his own formulas and writes class notes. Strategy is probably to understand his impossible class notes and learn from other online sources. Will take a lot of time and effort studying with friends to understand anything.	10	11/25/2022
ME144	See EE144			
ME156	9.00	Took with Professor Greaney, granted it was online but it seemed like nothing he was teaching was on the exams? Content on the exams wasn't even in the book. I stopped attending lectures around week 6 and just studied on my own. Somehow I got a B+ but I was beyond stressed out the entire time, so good luck :)	9	2/1/2021
ME170A	2.50	The class was quite easy, but that gave me a false sense of security so I didn't perform as I expected in the end. The class material is diverse, but relatively simple. Take the labs seriously, as the lab memos (the assignments) make up most of the class grade. There's extensive use of MATLAB when examining the lab results. Overall, don't slack and procrastinate,  just put in some effort and it's an easy A.	3	8/24/2018
		The class is pretty easy and is almost a guaranteed A. The final was a bit harder than the midterm so I had a false sense of security that almost made me lose my A. Really focus on the labs as those make 50% of your grade and can make or break your grade at the end.	2	6/21/2020
ME180	4.00	Lasers and Optics- One of the Mechanical Engineering Tech Electives, one of the coolest TE's out there, if ur interested in light waves, polarization, refraction, etc. Course still in development. Some topics were difficult, but Prof. Luat Vuong did not test on the difficult stuff.	6	11/25/2022
		Professor Vuong will listen to u if u guys collectively complain together. The TAs were super super helpful and she does leave out some of the details of what u should include in ur lab reports, hw, etc. but her passion for this subject is pretty cool pretty easy tech elective if u know how to set expressions given a diagram (sometimes she doesnt really tell u what ur solving for or what variables to use for said expressions but it's ok that's what makes this class pretty easy) if i can get an A in this class so can u. also like 2/3 of the class stopped showing up after the midterm (myself included ofc) bc honestly we only had 2 genuine lectures and never again since every lecture got turned into a lab time lol the only thing u have to worry about are finals tbh bc midterms count just as much as this quiz thing that ur guaranteed 100% on and lab reports are iffy depending on her mood or the number of people that complained about it for an extension or something i recommend easy tech elective fr oh and if ur bad at coding pls dont ask her to take the final online bc she doesnt really teach u lines of code ur expected to know :)	2	1/20/2023
MGT201	7.00	Great professor, but lots of homework	7	3/24/2019
MGT231	9.00	Trash class	9	3/24/2019
MGT252	10.00	Trash class, trash professor. A lot of my friends failed	10	3/24/2019
MSE160	7.00	This class was a pain but maybe only because of the quarantine situation. Her midterm was 70 questions in 70 minutes. Her quizzes in lab are so oddly specific and timed so it's almost as if they expect you to memorize every small detail about the machinery. She is not lenient what so ever. No curve.	7	5/17/2020
MUS001	1.50	Francis Moore is a super nice violinists. I have her as my violin instructor. Just do the work and put some effort and you'll get an A	1	7/1/2017
		Super Easy A. I took it with Frances Moore and it filled my humanities breadths. Attendance is mandatory tho. 	2	3/27/2020
MUS002	2.00	Dr. Walter Clark is good. He doesn't care if you don't show up, though you REALLY should because he doesn't upload lecture notes, which tests are 100% based on, and you can't really get the information anywhere else. Not much material to memorize. Just go to lecture and copy what he writes down + you'll be completely fine 	2	3/16/2020
MUS005	6.00	Women in Music with Professor Xochitl Chavez was an easy course but it does require work. There is a final presentation that you have to do that can be presented for extra credit or turned in without presenting. It is much better to present since you get the option to have questions from your selected artist to be showcased in the final exam. There are listening parts to the exam that is best done by taking time listening to the examples required every week. There are plenty of extra credit options, but show up to lectures because attendance is a huge part of your grade (a whole letter in fact). Presentation lectures will not be posted on iLearn so take notes and read the book. (Currently there are no options to get a free ebook, and purchase the book through the site the professor recommends or you risk paying $50 more.	6	4/15/2020
MUS006	5.00	Professor Nana is a great teacher, if you want to know more about music from different cultures, this is a class for you. However the workload for this class is fairly big. She does not upload her powerpoint slides nor any listening examples on iLearn so you must go to lecture. Total of 3 tests, one big final paper, and a final test.	8	5/29/2018
		Professor Ritter was energetic and was fun to see him perform some of the music. Make sure to attend lectures (quizzes will be based heavily on them). Professor was so understanding he cancelled one of the quizzes and the final due to COVID and the uprisings across the nation. There is a term paper make sure to include all the things it’s asking for and you basically get a good great. Discussions are helpfully it’s a review of the music learned that week. Overall easy class. 	3	6/8/2020
		Professor Ritter is always enthusiastic and makes lectures very fun. I would say it was a little hard trying to identify certain sounds and instruments only because I knew nothing about music. He was very helpful though so that was good. 	5	12/28/2020
		"Mandatory attendance, 3 listening quizzes (MCQ), no midterm, a 5 page term paper that for some reason cannot be about something he covered, and the final was basically a collection of questions from the listening quizzes + 1 short answer (~450 words).
Dr. Ritter is very energetic and fair. The class covers a lot of the world and knowing how to play music prior will likely help you a lot. Memorization is key."	6	3/18/2022
		Taken with Panikker, who was friendly.  Discussion Responses and class/discussion participation points were practically freebies.  Study notes and study guide for an hour before each quiz (MC) and you should get a B or better.  Paper required attending an in-person event, but was graded casually.  Easy A.	3	12/9/2022
MUS008	5.25	Took it with Prof Deborah Wong (amazing prof makes class enjoyable). There are 4 quizzes (not cumulative) and 1 essay, no final and no homework. She uses PollEverywhere for participation so attendance is needed (or you could just be on PollEverywhere all the time). 	3	3/7/2019
		Literally dont take the class. Everyone says that its easy but its NOT. I had to S/NC the class because I was so close to getting a C. No matter how much you study, she will quiz you on random stuff in the textbook. 	10	3/23/2019
		"A fun and easy class! I definitely learned a lot more than I thought I would. Dr. Wong is very engaging and is enthusiastic about the material and makes sure to teach it with a very non-white-centric viewpoint to make sure we get the full ""story"" and context of American popular music of days gone by. 1 1000-word paper on a biopic of her choice (we did Selena), and 4 non-cumulative quizzes (the last quiz is the ""final"" and covered 1970s-onwards) - the criteria for the biopic paper is easy to understand and the quizzes are extremely straight-forward. Discussion is nice, we sometimes talked about stuff that wasn't covered in class but is in the textbook, and each discussion before the next quiz was dedicated solely to review. "	2	3/2/2020
		Took this class with Professor Wong. Decently harder than I expected. It's not that the material was difficult to comprehend, it's that there's 4 quizzes in the class and each has 15 questions and is worth fifteen percent of your grade. So getting a few questions wrong means you're screwed. And it's pretty easy to mess up since some questions are based on memory of what an artist looks like or a certain part of a song out of a required 30 songs that are required. Study for quizzes, go to discussion. This was my lowest grade of the quarter, but I got an A. 	6	3/28/2020
MUS010	1.00	I took this class fully online with Professor Moore. It was pretty easy, although it's hard to learn music online. Concepts are easy and not too much work.	1	6/8/2020
MUS014	2.00	Ez pz. Go to discussion, don't procrastinate the essay, exams is stuff on lectures. You should probably at least read the textbook pages.	2	12/27/2017
MUS016	4.00	Had Walter Clark Winter 2023. His slides contain a lot of information so more than anything take notes on what he says. However, he tends to get off topic a lot making it difficult to say what to take notes on and what not to take notes on. His exams have a listening portion (music) and a written portion. Memorizing the composers and the songs they wrote is crucial during the exams.	4	1/27/2023
MUS017	4.50	Took it with Chavez, exams were fair but a little bit on the hard side. There were two midterms and 1 final	6	11/2/2019
		I took Xochilt Chavez online, it was not that hard, but it was very disorganized.	3	12/15/2020
MUS018	2.00	Took it with Prof Walter Clark and he was honestly the best. Yeah, the subject did get boring sometimes during lecture and he doesn't post slides, but overall it was an easy class if you just look over the study guide before the test. Exams include a multiple choice, listening, and essay section. Essay is given on the study guide, and it's exactly the same questions on the actual midterm. Grading policy is straightforward, but the only thing I wasn't a big fan of was the mandatory attendance for lecture. Would recommend taking this class as a fine arts course	3	3/21/2018
		This class is an easy A with Walter Clark. Only need to go to lecture to write down the notes he puts on the projector. 2 midterms, 1 final, 1 essay due at end of quarter. The exams are all MC, only have 3 options to choose from, and can be taken on a phone. Some of the listenings were confusing but easy if you study 1-2 days before the test.	1	6/16/2019
MUS020	1.00	Literally, go to class. BS the assignments. Go to class, and he will give you answers to the final. 	1	4/12/2018
MUS021	1.00			
MUS030A	3.00	Dr. Barnett is a pretty funny guy and really cares about his students and their success. His assignments are pretty easy and straight-forward--he tells you everything you're being graded on and grades fast. Attendance is mandatory and so is accessing the textbook (you use the same textbook through the whole 30 series and even the MUS131 series)	3	6/22/2020
MUS080E	7.00	Individual private Voice Lessons with either a male or female instructor. Worth 1 unit. There is a required final performance in front of other classmates taking this class. You will be given a music piece to sing to, could be classical or before 1980s pieces, but no contemporary music. You do have to practice by yourself for at least 5 hours a week. 	7	4/16/2020
MUS080R	1.00	Violin Class	1	7/1/2017
MUS165	2.00	Concert Band/Wind Ensemble, literally only graded on attendance. Dr. Andress is pretty chill. 	2	5/17/2018
NASC092	1.00	(Fall 2020 Online) This class is for the PERSIST Research program. I had Dr. Nugent and it was honestly a pleasure. She is a sweet soul that is absolutely intelligent and intimidating because of it haha. Nonetheless, she allowed a welcoming environment that had room for errors and asking questions. I learned a lot from her in this course even though at times the course seemed to be a little unorganized. 	1	12/28/2020
NASC093	2.00	Freshmen Advising Seminar: Just show up, take notes, and learn. The class requires homework but you do not need to buy the textbook. You will never use that textbook so go only for the online things to access.	1	4/16/2020
		The main lecture is by Morrison and she is very chill...the only problem you would have is when you have discussions, try to avoid getting Nancy Vasquez. Remember one thing for the class, if you miss the class or are late you can't make up for it and it will affect your grade. The classes are both pass/fail so it isn't bad but if you miss a class that is your only strike. Miss more than one and you will be failed for both the discussion section and lecture section. Oh yeah there's a textbook which is completely useless but you need it for the access code. Honestly it was a huge waste of money because you never use it. The only thing you will use however is Launchpad. Make sure to keep up with ur discussion section person because they don't always update your grades correctly on there.	3	10/20/2020
NASC198	2.00	Aquaponics. Fun.	2	3/13/2020
PBPL001	3.82	I had professor Bruce Babcock. He's pretty cool, slightly unorganized. But if you go to lecture and do the 3 assignments, you'll be just fine. If you're interested in government you should have no problem taking interest into this class and getting a good grade. Readings not necessary	4	3/24/2019
		Took with Prof Babcock. Attend lectures and you'll be fine. Exams are fair and easy. Weekly readings but he goes over it during lectures so you don't really have to do them. 2 midterms and a cumulative final.	2	6/16/2019
		Honestly read the book before you attend lecture and really try to listen to professor Ramakrishnan. Doing all that reading and cramming the night before your Policy Brief, final, and midterm really isn't it, so get on top of it. Also T.A.'s will give you a long list of things to study, but like only a quarter of those things will be on the test. I barely attended lecture and I studied the night before my finals. Passed the class with a B+.	4	12/18/2019
		Taken with Babcock. Easy class somewhat tedious assingmnets.	3	3/12/2020
		prof brady fall 2020: exams & first two writing assignments were dumb easy, third 2000 word assignment should be ok if you don't procrastinate. dr. brady's really nice and although he's not v flexible for individuals he did make the final optional and promise a curve	5	12/22/2020
		"Taken online with Professor Serieux-Lubin. Professor was extremely uninvolved, most interaction was through the TA. Never started anything before the day it was due in this class & got an A easily. 

-3 Written assignments (~200, 800, 2000 words)
-Exam every 2 week on 2 weeks of material that you learn from videos + linked readings. Used to be 2 short answer + multiple choice, was just multiple choice by the end of the quarter
-attendance taken once a week from discussion with the TA
-plenty of extra credit offered via discussion boards/submitting early drafts of written assignments"	2	3/23/2021
		Took it with Brady and Babcock Spring 2021. Please avoid this class if you are a stem major as it will get in your way of focusing on your major classes. I have a few complaints. 1. There is a lot of reading. They are mostly 5-10pg articles and they average about 7 different articles A WEEK. The exams are reading heavy so you have to read the articles to do well. 2. The TAs are absolutely useless. It sucks enough that all lectures are recorded so you have no contact with the professor. My TA took an average of 1 week to respond to my emails, which would be too late anyway. The only actual class time is during discussion and most of the TAs for this class will straight up say to not ask them about the material because they don't have time to look at it. For exams, they tell you to do the reading, give you a study guide of what they think will be on the exam and call it a day. 2. There are 4 midterms and 1 final exam. Basically, there is an exam every other week on Fridays, so be careful about what classes you might have on Fridays. 4. The assignments are tedious and boring and the TAs grade harshly for things like citations, grammar, word count, etc. If you go over or under the word requirement, you will get points deducted. 5. The professors are not empathetic. A peer of mine got sick with covid and was in the hospital. When they let the professor know since they missed an assignment, the professor said that they should have told him sooner and the student received a 0 on the assignment. Good things about the course: 1. open-note exams 2. recorded lectures if that's your thing 3. Sometimes curves exam scores. 4. They drop your lowest exam score. (somehow got an A, but still. Good luck lol)	6	5/7/2021
		I took this class online, for spring quarter in 2021, because I had read some threads recommending this class. This class is basically Busywork: The Class, and I would strongly, STRONGLY advise against taking this class if you don't need to. I took this class for credits, and the amount of time I had to put into this class was ridiculous. I ended up having to put more time in this class than the other two classes I took this quarter combined. The grading for this class is based around biweekly exams (that's 5 exams total - 5!!) that are open-book, but because they are open-book, the professor takes that as an excuse to grill you on minute details of the readings assigned for that week. Readings are pretty lengthy, and on top of doing readings as well as studying for each of the 5 exams, you are also given writing assignments that progressively get longer on creating your own public policy. I did fine on these writing assignments, as well as the exams. It feels like you only have to do the bare minimum to succeed in this class, but the bare minimum is still a ridiculous amount of time. 	5	6/2/2021
		The papers were annoying to write and I feel like you don't really learn that much. It's easy especially with Dr.Ahumada 	2	12/6/2021
		If you don’t delay this class is a cakewalk. The teacher pushed the quizzes back till the last day. I’m not sure if this is Covid specific, but the quizzes were also open note. If you are interested in writing research papers or like researching specific stuff this class is perfect	4	12/8/2021
		Taken with Bruce Babcock. It is ridiculously hard for an intro class. He prides himself on the fact that students get Cs on all his exams. The material is convoluted, and the TAs can't explain the material effectively. There is a quiz EVERY day, so if you miss one lecture, you're losing points. The exams are so hard and purposely confusing. 	9	6/1/2023
PBPL002	4.00	Took with Prof Brint. Group/partner discussions every lecture. Pop quizzes every week. 1 midterm and final. Interesting class and enjoyable. Quizzes & TA can make or break your grade. Optional debates that you can do but it is limited and assigned during the first lecture.	5	6/16/2019
		Taken with Professor Brint. Excellent teaching methods. Sometimes a bit slow on getting to the point. Class not difficult. Optional debates that can be substited for Midterm/Policy Report. Decently easy.	3	11/4/2019
		Relatively easy class, usually taught by Dr. Brint. Just study the slides and it is an easy A. 	5	12/10/2019
		Took it with Prof Vergara-Tapia, class content was interesting and straightforward. There is a midterm and a final, and weekly quizzes. Most test questions come from lecture 	3	7/5/2020
PBPL004	2.67	Easy class - completetly asynrchronous. Taken with Serieux-Lubin. Super easy midterm and papers. Easy/Free A basically	3	5/10/2020
		Took it with Prof Serieux Lubin, she was really understanding and kind. The class is 2 papers, 4 discussion posts, a midterm and final. The test questions are straight from lecture too. Great class. 	3	12/28/2020
		Class wasn't too hard, took it with Prof Seriuex Lubin during Fall 2020 so it was online and asynchronous. Open note midterm and final. She gives a lot of opportunity for extra credit near the end. 	3	12/28/2020
		Very easy! 2 policy briefs that were short (minimum 500 words) and the TA was lenient.	2	3/1/2021
		serieux-lubin winter 2021: so, so many extra credit opportunities. really don't have to read anything, although the readings are pretty interesting in their own right	2	3/20/2021
		Easy class if it is online. Took it asynchronously and the professor was good about announcements. Only 1 midterm, 1 final, and 2 papers. Lot's of extra credit. 	3	2/3/2022
PBPL101	6.00	Taken with Brady. Nice class a lot of application of sociological concepts and ideas. A lot of reading but the class is completely doable. Super nice and curves exams. Make sure you read/skim read for the exams - completely fair!	6	5/27/2021
PBPL102	4.00			
PBPL103	3.00	Taken with Jeffrey Allen. Amazing professor and definitely recommend. His lectures are informative and he keeps them interesting. His midterm and final are straightforward free response tests from the lecture content and there is one paper. Great guy to talk to as well!	3	3/24/2022
PBPL185	3.00	Taken with Newman. Super easy class consisting of reading quizzes. You dont really need to read the readings - just need to know how to skim the content appropriately. Besides that a short paper and attendance and thats all. Super accomodating and very good class	3	5/27/2021
PBPL191	2.00	As long as you attend some of the public policy events that are approved for this class and write reflections on them you'll pass. It is an S/NC course.	2	3/24/2022
PBPL198I	1.00	Public Policy Internship. Just do the 5 easy papers and get an evaluation and you are set. 	1	11/10/2021
PHIL001	3.58	You don't even have to read for this class just memorize the slides and listen to the lectures. Took it with Andreja Novakovic	8	3/27/2017
		Really easy class. The readings are basically useless because all the material you need for tests comes from the slides. Professor Novakovic isn't challenging anyone that much in this class since many people just take it to fill a breadth requirement. Just listen to what she says during lectures	2	12/13/2017
		Novachovic: If you attend the lectures and pay attention, you can succed. Paying attention and reading the passage ensures an easy B+ or A	2	1/3/2018
		Don't take it with Keller. He teaches the subject in a strange way and is difficult to listen to. 	6	3/19/2018
		Professor Wood is a great professor. No mid term, no final, just 3 papers throughout the quarter.	2	12/15/2018
		Took with Dr. Joshua Wood. Pretty straightforward class. 3 essays, and each essay added an extra prompt on top of the previous one. (Ex. If essay one asked you to explain an argument, the second essay asked you to do the same, and give a counterargument.) Essays were graded by the TA, No Midterm or Final Exam	3	1/8/2019
		Had Joshua Wood. This class really shouldn't have been that hard, but I had a picky TA who didn't use the professor's grading scale for the essays. No midterm, no final- just papers. Go to your TA's office hours to find out what exactly they are looking for in the essays. Barely have to show up to lecture	4	2/9/2019
		Took with John Fischer, extremely easy, your grade really depends on your TA, was able to get extra credit points, read the lecture slides and you're fine, you don't need to do the readings, no paper just 2 midterms and a final; show up to discussions	2	12/17/2019
		"The class itself was fairly easy. You don't even need to read. The people who determine your ""fate"" are your T.A'S. Everything is graded by your T.A. "	3	6/4/2020
		Taken with Luca Ferrero. He is a good professor, but he over-explains a bunch of concepts for most who are taking this class as a breadth course. The quizzes are TOUGH. You have 3 hours and it is technically open note, but its nearly impossible ton find the answer in a straightforward manner. Very weird grading scale - TA's do literally determine your grade and fate so be nice to them.	7	3/18/2021
		Dense and boring lectures, but the information is interesting. If that makes sense. Discussion is where it really matters, it'll help you retain info better. 	3	6/3/2022
PHIL002	5.00	Took it with professor Swanson. Just 3 papers, rarely attended lecture all slides are online but ask the TAs for help if you want a good grade on your paper. It seems straightforward but they have high expectations for them 	5	6/21/2019
		Took it with Dr. Wood & very helpful if you go to lectures, the exams and finals weren't too bad as long as you went to lecture 	3	3/7/2020
		took it with Swanson, just 3 paper, nothing hard	4	5/31/2020
		I took it with Wood. I would say, if you can connect with what's being said at lecture with the readings, this is an okay class. Somewhat lots of reading (ranging from like a short article to a chpt) for each class but overall, I think it was actually okay. The lectures and readings are kinda interesting and I didn't feel drowsy/kept up with the lectures. Would recommend if you're okay with reading/looking at things from someone else's POV	7	9/30/2020
		I had Swanson as prof and Andrew as TA. The material itself wasn't that bad, however the lectures (asynchronous on mondays and synchronous on wednesdays) were really long and full of information. Taking notes is important because a lot of the quiz/test material was from the lecture. For the papers, ask your TA what they're looking for because they help grade. Our midterm was 25 multiple choice and 5 essay (~ a paragraph answer) questions and was curved because not a lot of people finished and our final was an essay. we also had weekly quizzes but you could work with other people on them	5	5/23/2021
PHIL003	6.00	This class definitely requires some effort but honestly it was pretty interesting and I really liked the prof (Snelson). 	6	5/22/2021
PHIL003W	6.00	The TAs never coordinate with each other so the writing and the philosophy ones will never say the same thing. The professor is also boring and the readings can become quite difficult to understand.	8	8/23/2018
		I had this class with Professor Frost for Fall 2021 and ended up with an A. I believe the course itself is pretty interesting, but the readings/lectures are very long and sometimes confusing. The TA really makes or breaks the class imo but personally I loved my TA. As long as you finish the journal assignments, then you should be okay. Also, there's no final!! just two essays due (one on Week 5 and one of Week 7 I believe).	6	12/17/2021
		"I had Ethics and the Meaning of Life with Kim Frost as my prof. Frost is pretty chill and accommodating. All lectures were asynchronous, 1 in-person discussion section a week. No tests, no finals. There were two 5-6 page papers and weekly journal assignments (3-4 questions). The grading is a little confusing, but basically the more work you do the likelier you will have a good grade. There are no books to buy, everything is supplied with PDFs. TA’s are really important, my TA was wonderful and explained things well and helped us with everything. In general, if you keep up with the assignments and double check your ideas/thesis statements with the TA before writing papers you will get an A. Not a difficult class. Also, asynchronous lectures & readings can be skimmed as long as you can do the journal assignments well. 

Pre-requisite is Eng 1a and 1b. This is an English 1c class. Need to be good at forming ideas, actual writing is not as complicated."	4	1/20/2022
PHIL004	4.75	"Taking it with Prof Cherry Myisha. This class isn't offered every quarter, according to my TA. Must go to section as HW is 45% of your grade and discussion itself is 15%. Other than that, the midterm was pretty easy if you paid attention in lecture or at least went over lecture notes. HW is a 1 page ""essay"" on 2 questions from the book, but discussion is amazing. My TA Victor is great at explaining philosophical concepts and does a great job of utilizing section time."	3	2/28/2019
		Exams are free response. TA was amazing	3	3/27/2019
		"I took this class with Professor Cherry. It was pretty interesting as it discussed the origins of race, along with present implications. The professor seemed pretty interested in the course content and she only had one 30-40 minute lecture a week, which was pretty nice. There were only 3 homework assignments, 1 midterm, and 1 final. But, your grade really depends on your TA. Everything is free response and this class doesn't use rubrics. There's also a participation grade so you're required to have your camera on and discuss each class.

Overall, I would recommend taking this class. The content is pretty interesting. Just try to do some research on your TA. The TA is the one who really determines how you do."	4	6/2/2021
		class is very conceptual, few key details you have to memorize for exams etc, but overall the class really opens your eyes about racism and how its in our daily lives	3	3/16/2022
		The class is fun because it talks about the root and foundations of races. Your grade is all dependent on your TA cuz they will be grading ur essays (yes the class is just writing, no multiple choices), so try to pick a good TA. the whole grade is made up of discussion participations, 3 writing assignments, one final, and one midterm (no curves on exams and ECs). I had Sammie and he is A LEGEND. Super understanding and will grade you more easily if English is not our mother language. Professor Cherry’s lectures are fun and you can tell she is actually passionate about the things she is teaching. But, be sure to read the textbook and material before heading to the lecture and discussion. The midterm and final are super EZ, just make sure to do the study guide BECAUSE EVERYTHING on the study guide IS THE EXAM ITSELF. In conclusion take this class, and make sure to read.	4	3/17/2022
PHIL005	6.29	The professor made the class much harder than need be. As a fourth year taking a lower div. I can honestly say that was the hardest class I have ever taken. Even a friend of mine who majored in philosophy looked at what was expected for the final and thought it was ridiculous for a intro class.	10	12/19/2017
		Eric Schwitzgebel teaches this course. It isn't difficult as long as you attend lecture and read the material.	4	3/5/2018
		This class is a fair bit of reading but Prof. Schwitzgebel makes sure to clear up any confusion with extremely engaging lectures. Attendance is not mandatory but showing up to lecture is incredibly worth it as they're really interesting and he covers some topics not mentioned in the overheads (such as examples). 1 500-word essay, 1 1200-word essay, 2 midterms, and 1 final. The midterms are 10 quote ID, 10 multiple choice, and 2 short-answer, with the final being 20, 20, and 4 respectively. Essay rubrics are extremely concise and easy to understand. The professor is a wonderful, sweet man and is definitely one of my favorite professors on campus - he always makes time for his students and is incredibly understanding and personable. He teaches the class in the fall, so definitely take it with him if you can!	4	12/14/2019
		I took it with professor Wettstein. He very much focuses on religion. It wasn't that hard but it was boring and very theological. 	5	8/3/2021
		Took it with Eric Schwitzgebel. Ridiculous amount of reading. It's not hard to understand but it's the most reading I've ever had to do for a single class. But if you do all the reading the exams and essays are pretty simple. 	6	11/7/2021
		10/10 amazing class. I took this class just because its a funny name, but god its great. It will completely change your outlook on evil. This class isn't easy, but it is one of the best classes Ive ever taken. You need to do the readings, and although some are long they are very fun. Essays aren't easy, but I did them near the last minute so not really sure. Get a discussion that is when youre able to be focused, because discussion's were great. The TA and the Teacher know their stuff backwards and forwards, its incredibly impressive. If you need a philosophy credit, or hell if you just want a good class, take this one. 	7	5/27/2022
		took it with professor erik. i only took it because people who took it prior, said it was easy. I DIED during this class. the test is so difficult, but the essays were easy	8	11/15/2022
PHIL007	4.67	Professor (Coleen) was very poor at using time effectively in class. Often rambled/discussed some meaningless corner case for our content. Course material itself isnt too hard however. Book is also somewhat verbose and reading it can be a challenge. Quizzes are 90% of your grade (10% each, 9 total, during discussion). I HIGHLY suggest getting Akshay Ganesh for TA. He releases his personal notes the day before his discussion and they are extremely helpful. There are in class quizzes which are worth around 5% of your grade. The class is curved to a B-. As long as you do well on the weekly quizzes in your discussion, you'll do fine.	5	12/22/2018
		Professor Londen was really nice. The only way to prepare for the quizzes and to get an A honestly is to meet up with him during office hours and ask him to give some more examples of the sorts of questions he wants us to answer. Show up to lecture!	6	3/19/2019
		Prof. Londen teaches this class and is super nice and willing to help, you just have to communicate. This class was very difficult because you are learning a new skill. The class is curved though so I believe a 50% was actually a C. If you want to pass the class with an A which is 100% possible, start off strong and go to office hours starting week 2 before your first exam. There is a test every week so go to office hours every week because everything is built ontop of everything so if you dont understand something from a previous week it will harm you the entire quarter. The TAs and prof all grade each individual exam together so they try to give you as many points as possible. Final exam is optional.	9	9/10/2020
		Loved this class. Really interesting topics, although the essays can be difficult at times. I had Sammie as my TA and he was VERY helpful. He guided me through my essays when I needed help and replied quick when you emailed him. Professor Cherry lectures very well but she is NOT accessible at all. I've emailed her multiple times and have not gotten a single email back. Keep in mind that I'm writing this on Week 8. She's a great teacher, but it's just annoying when you have specific questions or comments about class and you're getting no reply. 	4	2/23/2022
		*Spring 2022 Online* I had Professor Wood and he is like the Bob Ross of teachers. He is so nice and super helpful. It's clear he has a passion for teaching. We had 10 question Canvas assignment due every Thursday but you could redo up to 3 times and a quiz every Friday which you could retake 2 times. He dropped the 2 lowest quizzes. Lectures were easy to understand and the homework and quizzes were not hard at all. I just skimmed his lecture notes before doing them and got 100s so you should be fine. I don't know if this is the format for in person but if this class is online TAKE IT. 	1	6/18/2022
		Took this with Colleen in Winter 2023. Overall, a pretty easy class. Participation in lectures was required in the form of Poll Everywhere questions. Generally, an assignment was due before each lecture, but they were graded on effort and not correctness. There were 3 exams, but (at least to me) none of them were too hard and could be completed with relative ease if you paid attention in lecture. The concepts taught in the course were also not terribly hard to understand. I remember only having a bit of trouble with the concepts in the first 2-3 weeks, but after that, everything felt easy.	3	3/27/2023
PHIL008	4.83	Since I was in honors, I had the professor as my TA in discussion. Very helpful and easy class. Got an A. It was more of an online class	2	7/1/2017
		very easy to learn everything, the end of the quarter is where it gets a bit hard, but nothing scary.	3	12/15/2018
		The professor Nagashima himself is a nice guy who is trying his best to teach. The class however I found a bit difficult. In the beginning the class was very easy to follow and was going at a steady pace Then out of nowhere towards the last couple of weeks we get thrown these difficult concepts which had little relation to what we learned in the beginning. Must have time to study outside of class or you will bomb the second midterm and final. I managed an A on both midterms but I invested quite a bit of time in study groups etc. It’s passable but as a breadth class it was a bit stressful. 	5	6/15/2019
		The class can get confusing if you have Michael Nelson but as long as you go to every lecture and disscusion and pay attention then you should do fine. 4-10 problems for homework a week but some hw sets may take a few hours. The concepts can be a little hard to grasp but the classwork is fairly low. Never studies for both midterms and I got an 88% on both.	5	12/10/2019
		Took it with Michael Nelson. This guy is so confusing in his lectures, and he wrote the book, which is worded just as he talks. Hard class tbh. Got an A minus because the final was hard as hell, even after getting a 94 and 100 on my two midterms, and over 100% on my homework. 	8	12/20/2019
		this class is definitely hit or miss; like either you'll find it super easy and get an A+ or you won't understand jackshit. if you're familiar with cs this class won't be too bad bc it's basically all boolean like true/false. but prof nelson is definitely not a good teacher and is super confusing. if you have mcdonald as your ta you'll be fine tho.	5	6/2/2020
		I had Professor Erich Reck, the materials might be difficult depending on how much you can comprehend logic, but the class is relative easy to pass. You get 3 tries for homework, extra credit problems on (most) quizzes and midterms. It is an easy A if you do homework, attend discussion, and watch lecture	1	11/24/2020
		I took this class with Andrew Law and he mentions this early on in the course but this course is easy in the beginning but it gets extremely difficult towards the end. We used an online website (Carnap) to do basically everything on but it was free so you don't have to pay anything. Just make sure you pay close attention especially after the first midterm since that's when stuff really picks up and gets confusing. I recommend attending every lecture because if you miss one you can get really far behind. There's also weekly homework, 2 midterms and the final. 	8	6/10/2021
		In my experience, CS/CE/EE majors easily carry this class while other majors may struggle a bit. The first half is just truth tables and logic functions, which are both super easy. The second half is all proofs, which is where some of the class started to struggle. About half the class ended with As and the other half got Cs/Ds. This is basically a math class disguised as a philosophy class so just keep that in mind. 	3	6/16/2021
		Took it with Prof Andrew Law online, he's an amazing lecturer and professor. He really cares about his students and is always available for help and questions. He would host review sessions before the midterms and the final. The first half of the class was a breeze but the second half (derivations) was a lot harder. The class is like PHIL007 in that there's no philosophical readings, rather learning a skill set and applying it to arguments and checking if arguments are valid or not. 2 midterms, 1 final, weekly homework sets due sunday night, discussion, book readings were recommended and uploaded on ilearn. 	7	6/18/2021
		Took with Erich Reck. If you go to class and pay attention to lecture, this is an easy A. It's more of a critical thinking/reasoning class than anything. Was able to get a 100 on the first midterm after going to only half of the classes, and didn't go to any from week 7 - week 10. Still got a 94 on the final pre-curve with 2 cram sessions before the final. Final was curved to a B average, no one got below an 85 on it. Midterm curves aren't as severe, but are definetly helpful. Go to discussion, TAs are incredibly helpful.	4	1/9/2023
PHIL009	3.60	"There's only 2 mandatory essays. 4 if you count the first one, which is a practice essay to get feedback and stuff, while the fourth one replaces your lowest essay score (provided that it was above a 70%? I believe). I got an A- but you still have to work for your grade, especially since the readings are pretty difficult to process BUT the professor (I had Joshua Wood) will give you outlines of the articles, so it's easier to understand. He's also pretty funny in the slack channel. One girl was like, ""Where is the 10th assignment?"" when we only had two essays, and he was like ""you're scaring people"" LOL. Make sure you don't procrastinate on your essays! My TA liked a direct approach to writing, so be concise with your wording and make it easy to understand. "	6	12/26/2020
		Took it with Dr. Joshua Wood during Fall 2020. No mandatory lectures and he gives you an free version of the textbook online. Dr. Wood is super sweet and his lectures (if you do decide to go) are essentially a discussion about the assigned readings. If you choose not to go, he offers recorded lectures and notes as supplements.  Homework are the assigned readings but you don't really need to read any of them unless you're choosing that specific one to write the essay about. No exams only four essays two of which are mandatory; the first one is a practice one and the last one is an extra credit opportunity. Each essay increases in page limit; the first one 1-2, second 2-3, etc. Essays are super easy and basically an analysis essay on the argument of the document. TAs grade the essays so it really depends on them. I had Gustavo for my discussion and he was pretty easy going, attending was also not mandatory. The only assignment was a discussion question regarding the material due every Wednesday and in the discussion he'd address those questions.	3	1/5/2021
		I took it with Dr. Wood. The class will be relatively easy, however there is a lot of reading. Some of the readings are interesting and will keep you entertained in a way, but sometimes they can be a bit hard to read. I recommend taking notes! Your grade is all based on papers! So, your TA will determine your grade. Averages for papers are B's, so as long as you have decent essay-writing skills and actually read the papers or looked at lecture notes/videos, you'll do fine! Grammar doesn't seem to matter too much on papers, but the information will matter A LOT! Don't push off all the readings till last minute!	4	12/19/2021
		Had Professor Wood for Fall 2021 (asynchronous). Pretty chill class, Wood's lecture vids were ~15min long and he provided notes that summarized each reading. No exams, only four papers (the first one was optional). How well you did in the class depended on your TA since they're the only one who read your essays. I had John Green, and he was nice but graded ruthlessly. General consensus was that TA's liked papers that were concise and straightforward.	3	1/7/2022
PHIL010	2.00	If you're taking it with Jeremy Pober, expect a pretty easy class. He's a great professor and lectures very clearly so that the material (which can be sometimes challenging) is broken down into simple concepts. You're going to write two papers, with the first paper being 10% of your grade and the second paper being 15%, but both are only 1.5 pages long. The midterm was easy for me and I anticipate the final on being equally simple. On his exams, he dedicates 5 questions for you to explain your previous answers and, if he thinks they're acceptable explanations, you will be able to earn the points back if you missed the question. Overall, pretty enjoyable experience; I would take him again.	2	3/4/2020
PHIL030E	8.50	Professor Muller is a bit quiet when he lectures but he’s helpful for using examples to simplify concepts. Midterm was not so bad but your grade depends on your TA. Likewise for your essay too since there’s only one. Entire grade is balanced by midterm, essay, and final! 	8	12/12/2019
PHIL030I	6.25	Took this class with Professor Harmer. IMO a decent professor, but the lectures were pretty dry and boring at times. 4 open-book quizzes ONLINE worth 5pts each (20% of grade), along with 2 essays (first is 3pgs, worth 10%, next is 5pgs, worth 30%). He posts the lecture notes on ilearn, but I recommend going to lecture because he breaks down all the confusing concepts/explains pretty well. Just do the readings ahead of time, go to discussion (TAKE IT WITH ANDREW LAW, bc he really helps clarify everything; I understood the material more when he explained it than when the professor did lol). Passed with an A, but you definitely need to put in some work to get an A in the class. Forgot to mention: on the final, you get to bring a cheat sheet (1 page handwritten) with anything you want to write down: Prof Harmer distributes the essay questions for the final a week before, so you can just write down your final essay on that piece of paper walk in and copy it down on the final exam.	5	4/2/2018
		Took this class with Professor Harmer. Overall, the class was okay. I have no interest in Philosophy and was only taking it because it's a requirement, so I found the class boring majority of the time. Class is reading heavy, but he breaks them down really well during lectures and in my experience, my TA did well on breaking them down during discussions (mandatory) too. 3 quizzes, 2 papers, 1 final. For the quizzes, the questions ask you to find a specific quote from the readings and explain them, so read closely! The papers aren't too bad and he gives you a lot of time to finish them; make sure to go to office hours if you need help. The final wasn't too bad; there were mc questions, free response questions, a long answer question. He gives out the long answer question a couple of weeks ahead and also allows a double-sided cheat sheet. Due to certain circumstances, the final was online and not the normal in-person style.	5	3/29/2020
		Fairly easy class to get A if you put in the effort. Attend lectures since Professor Harmer will break down the texts so you can understand it better; do the readings because it will help you on the free-response quizzes and essays; and attend discussion since that's part of your grade. Final is decent since he allows a cheat sheet and gives out the prompt one week early.	7	4/22/2020
		Pretty easy class. Two essays, open note/book quizzes, and a final	8	5/14/2020
PHIL101	8.00	If you are a philosophy major, take this course as early as possible. The skills learned from Dr. Macnamara are invaluable. You'll feel capable of tossing out a few publications before you graduate. 	8	1/9/2019
PHIL113	4.00	"Took with Andrew Law Winter 2021. As a BCOE student it's not bad at all, pretty much just a 10-20 page reading before each class and he just explains it in more detail during lecture. No homework or exams, you only have to write two essays the entire course. The hardest thing is coming up with new contributions so you can't just write a compare and contrast essay on two of the readings. Just try to think about the most interesting thing you read and why it's interesting, then talk to Andrew he can definitely give good suggestions for essays. 

Also for BCOE: this class does not count towards your DEPTH, I thought it did and I had to fight to make it count."	4	11/7/2021
PHIL124	5.50	Easy class, confusing professor, TA is anal over everything. I had Nelson as a professor, and while he isn't super strict or anything, he could elaborate on a few points here and there. I had Tayor as a TA, and while he's way better at teaching the material, he sucks at grading. Not only that, but he's inconsistent with his grading. He does not believe in partial points for any extra credit questions. We had weekly homework and some example problems on iLearn. The example problems were way easier than the homework problems and were more focused on teaching material than helping us see patterns in derivations.	4	12/22/2017
		"This class is really easy if you took PHIL008 (Intro to Logic, maybe that's 8 I don't remember which one it is). I think only Michael Nelson teaches it. He's a very unorganized professor that likes to randomly change the homework and lectures at will. If you didn't take PHIL008, I hear it was very difficult and troublesome to pick up the course content because they assume you know PHIL008 stuff from Week 0. Nothing from PHIL008 is reviewed, they just assume you already know it and they move on with the schedule.
The course involves 9 homeworks (assigned every single week starting from Week 2 to Week 10), two midterms and a final. It also has a bunch of in-class quizzes involved (to incentivize people to come in at 8AM I guess?), some ""improvement"" score that's worth 5% of your grade and discussion attendance is mandatory. If you miss discussion, your OVERALL course grade gets docked 4% every single time if you don't have a valid excuse. 
Course content includes semantic proofs, main operator identification, truth tables, countermodels, logical consequence, propositional logic (AND / OR / IF, THEN / NEGATION, etc), quantificational logic (For All, There Exists, etc), and A LOT of derivations. Like, A LOT of derivations. If you took PHIL008 then you know how the derivations go; they basically just build on the derivations from PHIL008 and added some new operators for propositional logic. In the last few weeks, they'll teach you how to do quantificational logic derivations which is much more difficult but manageable."	6	12/17/2018
		I had this with Michael Nelson. He's not that great at explaining the material, but since it's not that particularly difficult, you should do fine with the book and example problems he posts online. Though for my class, discussion was mandatory otherwise you'd lose 4% from your final grade, and the TA was better at explaining things than the professor. The class isn't exactly easy per say, but if you put some effort into learning the material, you should be fine. Some derivations can be difficult and time consuming, but the class is manageable overall.	5	2/12/2019
		"Took with Nelson in Winter 2020. This class gives you DEPTH and TECH ELECTIVE credit. I didn't take PHIL 008 before this so derivations made me go ""wtf"" for the first 2 or 3 weeks. Difficulty was 6/10 at first since I didn't know how to properly construct derivations and then apply the rules. Go to the TA for help and have them go through the fundamentals. Once you catch on, the class becomes 4/10 in difficulty. The other reviews of this class still apply. "	6	10/11/2020
		It’s not that hard… but it might make you really sad for the people waste their lives studying philosophy. 	4	2/22/2023
		"Took the class with Nelson in Winter 2022. Not a great experience. His lectures are so confusing that even a classmate did a better job explaining than he did. The beginning of the class is fine and all the derivation rules are easy to understand. Then the class got super hard when it comes to semantic proofs. Finally it became fairly easy again after that. The real pain in the butt is that if you fail any one of his three exams, you fail the class. IMO it is a ridiculous system and puts a lot of unnecessary stress on the students. I hated it. But since this class fulfills multiple requirements for me, guess I'll just grind it out anyway... 
P.S. Anthony Stoner is a fantastic TA though. Do take his discussion if possible."	8	3/8/2023
PHIL151	3.00	Took with Alexandra Newton. As a computer science major, I found this class pretty interesting due to the professor. One in-class writing assignment (20%), two take-home quizzes (10% each), one 5-7 page final paper (25%), one in-person final exam (25%). She grades pretty leniently, considering the fact I haven't written an essay in 4 years, but still walked away with a B+. Attendance mandatory (10%). Overall, found the class easy and fun as long as you attend class.	3	4/4/2023
PHYS002A	7.63	Take Gabor. He's absolutely amazing	7	7/7/2017
		Hai Bo Yu doesn't help with MasteringPhysics and the textbook isn't good.	8	8/10/2017
		Professor Hai Bo Yu was a nice guy, but his accent made it hard to understand sometimes, and he mostly just read off of premade lecture slides straight from the textbook. I learned everything from doing the homework and from watching videos online, not from him.	8	12/18/2017
		Exams are unpredictable. Avoid Joshua Lui. Other professors are much better.	8	12/16/2018
		Joshua Lui is okay, but exams were a bit hard. Allows you a formula sheet. 	8	12/20/2018
		Easy homework and clickers. Hard tests	7	6/15/2019
		Had Yongtao Cui. Was concerned since he has 0 ratings online so I didn't know what to expect. However, he's a decent professor. Exams are quite hard, midterms averages about 40-50%, same as final. Important to not fall back in this class as the material is quite hard to understand without going to class. I scored 20-25% above exam averages and that got me an A. 	7	12/16/2019
		Difficult because many students are balancing this class with CHEM 008A. Definitely recommend you to read up on each chapter during the weekend before the lecture. It helps you understand the material early on. I also recommend that you do the practice problems in the textbook for additional practice outside of HW. If you have Peng Wei, I recommend to go to office hours and ask him for help especially if you're falling behind. 	8	12/18/2019
		Took it with YongTao Cui. A very caring professor but a hard class. Averages for exams were about 40% but there was a fat curve at the end. Definitely do practice questions and make sure you understand the concepts.	8	12/19/2019
		I took this class with Beyermann in the summer of 2020. Would not recommend. His tests are difficult. Furthermore, the hw he assigns aren't similar to what the tests looks like. Granted that this class was in 5 weeks so take this with a grain of salt. 	10	7/24/2020
		Took the class with Beyermann over the summer, would not recommend with him because it was my first time taking physics so I was really lost, midterms were really hard 30-60% averages, final was doable. Try finding someone else first	6	9/26/2020
		"""Never took PHYS, but taking it with Professor John Ellison was the best choice ever! He is very patient in answering questions during lecture, reexplains concepts that are hard/what he thinks most students struggle with, and is very very understanding of the pandemic conditions! His midterm is very similar to his practice exams and homework is difficult so if you struggle with that don't worry to much just make sure to understand the practice exams and concepts. Final is NOT cumulative so that helps too. Does online clickers for credit so class is kinda mandatory and I never read his reading notes before lecture, but doing that would've helped me .
PHYS 2A is known as a weeder class, but I learned a lot and walked out with a B+ because of Prof Ellison so definitely take it with him!"""	7	12/16/2020
		Took it with Beyermann online during Spring 2021. His grading system is very fair; I just suck at physics. Study a lot and do extremely well on the first midterm, because the material gets really difficult after that. Also try to get as many points as possible on the poll questions because the amount to as much as a midterm. We had 2 midterms and a cumulative final. Try to stay on top of the material as much as possible, because it is really easy to fall behind. 	9	6/15/2021
		Joshua Lui was very clear, but his exams are hard. It's almost unfair. His lectures glosses over the topic for the day. His homework was okay. It didn't help. His curves are okay, but theres definitely professors who has better. I would not recommend. 	8	6/21/2021
PHYS02LA	6.67	Good grades if you do the labs properly.  Easy final.	5	8/10/2017
		They may have changed it, but I took Fall 2018 and the labs were literally the WORST experience I've had at UCR. However, the final was really easy and there was a curve so it isn't hard to get an A, just an annoying class to take.	7	2/18/2019
		I think it is imperative to read the lab before you come to class so you have somewhat of an idea to complete the lab. It will help save you a lot of points and time. It also helps to ask the TA for certain sections in the lab. In addition, final assessment was done online (as a timed iLearn exam). Honestly, if you are well prepared for the lecture and know how to do the labs, you should be able to ace the final exam. P.S. You are allowed to use your lab notebook during quizzes and the final assessment, so write down those formulas and concepts if you need it (as a cheat sheet). :) 	5	12/18/2019
		Took it online during Spring 2021. The lab notebooks were extremely difficult because they are very concept-based and require you to derive formulas you learn in lecture. To study for the final, read through your lab notebooks and the corrections TAs make so you know what you did wrong. 	8	6/15/2021
		Super difficult and completely dependent on the TA. My TA was horrible (spoke very softly, didn't make sense when he talked, didn't understand the lab) so both I and my grade suffered. The lab manual has grammar and procedural mistakes and throws a bunch of information at you at once. It is also very unclear with what it wants sometimes. TA's would give lab quizzes that were completely insane and out of left field. The final was ok if you had a thorough lab notebook, but still there was no way to prepare for it.	9	12/11/2021
PHYS002B	6.70	Take Wimpenny for his good curve, by the class is still challenging no matter who you take it with. It's hard to understand what exactly is going on most of the time. 	9	3/31/2017
		Wimpenny is boring but he has written exams so partial credit is possible	6	7/7/2017
		Mulligan is a good prof.  Look through all his slides and practice.  Big curve for class overall.	7	12/15/2017
		Had Mulligan. Very chill and relaxed with the course. Curve/cutoffs are very generous. Try to take him if possible, he didnt fail anyone!	3	12/31/2017
		Alot of forumlas to memorize. IF you get Jory Yamorff make sure you study, but he is a fair grader. Decent curve but not huge.	6	9/3/2018
		Mohideen has large curves with the avg being a B. Lots of formulas to memorize but not to difficult if you look at the units.	4	3/30/2019
		Took the class with Harry Tom over the summer, would not recommend, got an A+ but I had to sell my soul cause his midterm, quizzes, and final were some of the hardest things I've ever done. 	10	9/26/2020
		Took it online with Harry Tom during summer 2021. Got an A+ but the worst experience of my life. Honestly, the content itself isn't that difficult, but the prof expects so much of you as a student. The exams and quizzes were super unreasonable and difficult, and even the TAs said that, too. He didn't even give us a formula sheet. The TAs said they were going to try and do something about how difficult he makes this class, but I am not sure what or if it will work. If you can avoid him and don't mind spending 10 weeks on a physics class, I would recommend taking the class at a different time with a different prof. If you can't avoid him, I would suggest reading each chapter before the lecture and doing the homework way early on so you can ask questions at office hours. The best way to study for exams is to review quizzes and discussion worksheets, because there's a lot of similar themes since he writes his own questions. Even though he curved the midterm, quizzes, polls, and the final exam grades by A LOT, the midterm average was a ~39% and the final exam average was 49-50%. 71.5% was the cutoff for an A, and passing was a 40%. 	10	7/27/2021
		curve saves everyone 2nd half of the class is very hard	8	2/13/2022
PHYS02LB	4.00	If you don't know lecture stuff, it's hard to follow along.  Final is easy if you know where to put equations.	6	12/15/2017
		The exams are mainly theory based now with few calcs. Write down impt in your lab notebook and chill.	2	3/30/2019
PHYS002C	5.67	"Avoid Anderson. Google ""UCSD 1C final exam"" and there's over 100 practice problems from the equivalent course at UCSD"	7	7/7/2017
		Simple class, simple work, and extremely high grade boosts in Barton's class.	4	6/21/2018
		(Took online in Winter 2021 with John Barton) This was the easiest of the Physics 2 series for me. Content-wise, it has some topics from gen chem, which makes it familiar and a bit easier to understand. His exams were all multiple choice and open note. Quite a few problems were similar to practice exams and it was not difficult to do well in the class as long as you know how to do practice exam questions and the lecture examples. A lot of it is just knowing how to use the formulas/equations, so sometimes just knowing how to do math can help you solve the problems! Since the exams are on the easier side, he doesn't curve much so 90 = A, 75 = B, and 60 = C, but if averages are low, he may change the cutoffs slightly. The professor you take for physics in general will determine how well you do since some professors give more difficult exams, but will curve or adjust cutoffs accordingly.	4	3/22/2021
		Anderson; I would say this class is the easiest within the series. Though, it doesn't mean that it's a walk in the park. Anderson was one of the laziest professors. He sent us into breakout rooms so we can discuss with each other. He goes into the breakout room one time and ask if everything is okay. He leaves before we can respond. The only perk is that his study guide/discussion questions is almost exactly like the exams. He changes the number, but it's not difficult to grasp. 	6	6/21/2021
		Took it online during summer 2021 with Jory Yarmoff. The material isn't that bad, but don't underestimate the exams. Try to do well on the polls and hw because those will help your grade a lot at the end. 	6	9/9/2021
		"Took in in Spring 2023 with John Ellison, in person. Homework - 10% (weekly, not one HW after every lecture), MT1 - 15%, MT2 - 15%, In-class quizzes (pollev) - 5%, Discussion section - 10%, Final exam (cumulative) - 45%

Good lecturer. Has an accent. Posts a pdf word version (condensed and more detailed) version of his slides. Then after every lecture he posts the slides of the words separated and more organized, but all the words are the same from the condensed version). Posts a practice test before each exam. They are semi-reflective of what I have seen before, but some questions felt kinda new to me. Goes over PollEv questions. Writes on his tablet during class, draws pictures to help visualize concepts and works through the example problems with us, but does not post these notes. The work for the examples are in the condensed version. We finished in a timely manner, and often early (5-10 minutes). Class is manageable with other STEM courses. He was a great professor. Approachable during office hours (on zoom) as well as answering any quick questions after class.  "	7	6/9/2023
PHYS02LC	5.00	Write everything in your lab notebook and the final is a piece of cake.  Labs weren't too difficult either.	5	6/21/2018
PHYS006	2.80	Homework was based on effort. 	4	6/17/2020
		I took this with Professor Canalizo fall 2020. This was a super fun class to take if you enjoy science. It was basically an astronomy class including learning about different types of stars, gravity, planets, and things of that sort. There were weekly homework assignments around 10 questions, but the answers come directly from the lectures. Discussion sections are optional to attend, but found them very helpful. The TAs would be there to go over any homework questions. 2 midterms and a final (all open note). 	2	2/23/2021
		Tests and quizzes are easy if you attend lectures, everything is on the slides. There is a weekly quiz thats only 2 questions and taken from the homework assignment. The homework assignment is essentially a study guide, it’s not actually due and the TA’s go over all the answer in discussion.	5	2/17/2022
PHYS007	7.00	I recommend Bill Gary as he is a very accommodating professor and cared about the difficulty of the course for those who did not have a strong science background. This class focuses more on cosmology and overviews the main contributors and topics in physics. There is little to no math at all since learning was more conceptual. Weekly homework, which the quizzes are based off of and the TAs basically give you the answers beforehand anyways. One midterm and final, which he recycles questions he used  previous exams.  	7	4/7/2021
PHYS008	6.00	This class is a good mix of memorization and conceptual math. It can be difficult for some people who struggle with memorization or math. However, if you put in a lot of effort, you'll definitely finish with at least a B. Attend lectures, practice on MasteringPhysics and do the practice midterms/finals. There is a major curve at the end, so don't stress too much. The midterm and final averages were around a 60 percent.	6	12/20/2018
PHYS018	4.67	Everything is curved and extra credit is provided so you cant fail	4	3/28/2017
		Taken with Brian Siana, super cool professor the class overall is fine and easy to follow but since it is made for non-science majors it can be difficult as there is a lot of math required	7	1/16/2019
		Took with Brian Siana. He is so nice and inspiring. He genuinely cares about the environment and actually does every day activities that reduces his carbon footprint. Class has a lot of math problems so make sure to study with the homework. Homework is optional but weekly quizzes during discussions. TAs makes the quizzes so if you're lucky, your TA might make easy questions/give you hints during discussion. 	3	6/16/2019
PHYS020	3.50	Took with Frederick Hamann, it was online because the campus shutdown. Midterm 30%, Final 40%, Quizzes 30%. We took the quizzes each week at the discussion session, it's only 2 questions. He gave us study guides for the midterm and final and also released all the possible quiz questions for the current week every week, that's how I managed to get an A in the class. No math to do or formulas to memorize in this class, you just need to remember vocab and concepts. Go to lecture and take notes.	4	6/19/2020
		"At the time of writing this, I haven't finished the class, but it's the 8th week and I already know I'm going to pass, so I feel like I can write a pretty good review of the class. I took this class with Laura Sales in Spring 2023 and it's a very easy class. There's lecture participation in the form of PollEverywhere, but you're only required to do about 80% of the them to get full credit, so you safely miss two or three lectures throughout the quarter. Every week we get a Homework assignment, but you don't really have to do it as your TA in discussions go over the answers with the class. At the end of discussion you're given a quiz, which are just three questions from the Homework assignment, meaning they're quizzes you can easily get 100% on every single time. Then there's three exams. All of them are 10 questions long, online, and open-note, which makes them pretty easy. Only reason you should get a bad score in the exams is if you don't know how to navigate through your notes or the textbook. Now she decided this halfway through the course, but only two highest scoring exams will go into your grade, making this class even easier. Not to mention, she also offers 5% worth of extra credit where all you have to do is say one good thing about the week's lectures and one bad thing.

TLDR: Easy class if taken with Sales "	3	5/26/2023
PHYS037	4.57	I had Prof. Mobasher. He curved the course almost a whole letter grade after the final. The class was all theory of the Big Bang and the events after it.(Almost five weeks were spent talking abt the Big Bang) No math involved. 	3	4/3/2019
		Homework is easy since you can just google it but the material is hard to understand if I could go back in time I wouldn't take this class again. 	6	12/10/2019
		There's a lot of difficult content but Mobasher curves the tests greatly	7	12/15/2019
		Love Mobasher as a professor but the material is dense and hard to understand for non science people. Final and midterm is worth 25% of overall class and hw is 50%. Do with that what you must, but I personally would not take again not worth the stress.	10	2/18/2021
		Had it with Prof. Mobasher. Curves the test and google is your friend for homeworks and tests.	1	2/23/2021
		Took the class online with Prof. Mobasher. Super easy class, all homework could be found online, and both the midterm and final were open notes.	2	3/12/2021
PHYS040A	6.05	This class the exactly equivalent to AP Physics 1(but they don't give credit for some reason). Pay attention during rotation(moment of inertia, rotational kinetic energy). It's harder than it looks. 	5	12/18/2017
		You definitely need to read the textbook thoroughly and watch a ton of Khan Academy videos or else you're going to do really bad in the class. One midterm and one final. No quizzes. Do your homework. Mastering Physics is a pain, especially with significant figures, but that will definitely make or break your grade.	10	12/18/2017
		If you have any physics background (high school, etc) this class will be easy peasy.	3	12/26/2017
		Most people weren't Reedy for the final. Overall pretty easy class; homework, clickers, 1 exam, 1 final. Just follow along with the class & know how to use the equations.	1	5/17/2018
		Professor Reddy. Overall grade is curved at the end.	5	12/15/2018
		Honestly, this class was harder than 40B and 40C for me. I got a C in 40A while I got a B+ in 40B and an A in 40C... Make sure you do a ton of practice problems and read the book.	8	12/16/2018
		Read the textbook, do a lot of practice problems. Bombed the final and got a C in the class but I also didn't do most of the homework and stopped going to lecture consistently. Just keep up and you'll be fine. Curved at the end; Reddy	8	12/18/2018
		Took this class with Reddy. Max all your other scores because you never know how the curve will affect you. Got a B- on the midterm  and then proceeded to get a D+ on the final and barely ended with a flat A so I got lucky solely because I made sure everything else was near 100%. As for the labs, don't just read the lab manuals beforehand - try and set up your lab pages/tables and answer the questions too. And if they don't provide excel spreadsheets to do calculations in, make them yourself because it'll save you a lot of time, especially if your TA is strict.	6	12/31/2018
		basically like AP Physics 1 with some other topics included and excluded. If you've taken AP Physics 1 and put in the work, this should be an easy A. No quizzes, only need to participate in 80% of clicker questions for a 100%, labs were sort of confusing at times but if you understand labs then you will be an A on the lab final.	2	12/12/2019
		took it with Reddy. his lectures are boring and all he does are problems. huge curve i got a 45 on the midterm and 81 on the final 79 on the lab portion 100 on discussion 97 in homework and it came out to a solid B+ with the curve	6	12/21/2019
		In discussion, the TA gives optional physics questions that are far harder to solve than those in class. Instead of doing everything, learning to solve these will ensure you succeed!	7	3/21/2020
		Professor Thomas Kulman was chill and funny for this class, homework was easy but the midterm was kinda hard. Overall alright class	5	8/10/2020
		"I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH DO NOT GET MICHAEL ANDERSON UNLESS YOU WANT TO TEACH URSELF EVERYTHING. It's not worth it either switch profs or drop him. He does not teach anything nor does he explain anything in lectures. His style of ""teaching"" is to give a worksheet and have u do it on ur own. He does not provide answers for said worksheet nor explain how to do any of the problems ever. If you know physics by all means take the class for the units but if not avoid Anderson at all costs."	9	3/19/2021
		Screw Michael Anderson, worst professor I ever had at UCR, avoid him at all costs for any physics classes.	8	3/24/2021
		Had Anderson, class is very simple in terms of format, midterms (total of 2) are pretty much the same from class examples, and final takes questions from the midterms and practice tests. Make sure to attend lectures since he has clicker questions and participation activities. class is easy if you put some work. 	6	1/9/2022
		I came into this with no physics knowledge at all since I didn't take it in high school. Physics as a whole is hard, but for the most part you just use equations and combine them together to solve word problems. I had Reddy for this class, the class average for the midterm was somewhere around 40% (free response), and the final was multiple choice. I absolutely bombed the midterm and did average on the final, ended up with a B by some miracle. The curve was absolutely huge for Reddy (45% was a C- lol).	8	2/16/2022
		Took this class with Naveen Reddy in Fall 2022. His instruction was okay but I found that the textbook as well as previous high school physics courses (such as AP Physics 1) were more helpful. Make sure to put in the work in at least skimming through the book and the equations, especially if you haven't had experience in prior physics classes. Topics covered largely resemble AP Physics 1 curriculum from kinematics all the way up to rotational motion. The class also had generous curving, especially for the final (though that may be because of the UC strike going on at that time). Overall not a very difficult class, you just need to put in the work.	5	3/26/2023
		"Thomas Kuhlman one of the best physics professors. Good lecturing skills and will answer any questions you have.

The class itself is based around My Lab and Mastering a software through Pearson. Your grade comes from your performance on the grades, one midterm, lab, and the final. The grading system is based on points. The more points you earn the better your overall grade.

With the attached lab section, make sure to do well cause the grade from lab is added to the overall for the class. LSA pretty difficult so study."	5	4/7/2023
PHYS040B	6.39	Tsai is a terrrible professor but huge curves	3	3/29/2017
		homework was difficult. Practice exam was almost exactly the same as real exams. Hardest of the 40 series imo	9	4/1/2017
		"I had Boerge as my professor and would honestly recommend him to anyone. He posts his lectures online and is very passionate about Physics + wants everyone to succeed. Make sure to go to his office hours in order to get any clarifications sorted out. If you also have Boerge, he basically covers 99% of the material from the textbook so you do not really have to read (although he will quiz you some concepts from the textbook during clickers).
In terms of the class, if you suffered through 40A, you will definitely suffer through 40B. The midterm was fairly simple, as it only covered about three chapters, but the final will definitely kill everyone's grade (however, it is not cumulative).
Discussions are mandatory and there was a quiz every class -- something not mentioned in the syllabus. According to my TA, 50% of one's discussion grade is based off attendance and the other 50% is based off the quiz grades.
Clickers were not based off participation -- something that is different from 40A. Make sure you attend every class as those points will matter."	7	3/24/2018
		"The individual concepts and homework aren't too bad, the main difficultly in the class comes from the fact that all 3 professors write 1/3rd of the final and how Mills combines different concepts from the entire course into one question. For example this quarter(winter 2018) he somehow combined pistons, ideal gases, heat of vaporization, and thermodynamics into a single fucking question. Even if you understand the physics behind all these concepts perfectly, his questions feel like a puzzle. As far as I can tell, the other two professors make extremely ""easy"" straightforward questions and the curve is usually pretty nice. 

In the past, you would want to avoid Mills because he makes the hardest questions and he doesn't teach that well but now that all the professors are making the final, it might actually be beneficial to have him as a professor because you could get used to his madness before the final. "	8	3/25/2018
		The class is pretty reasonable and doable and the midterm isn't that bad. The final was nothing like any of the practice or homework. It was extremely difficult and ridiculous	8	3/27/2018
		Content is relatively straight forward and homework reflects what is taught in class. Quizzes are ripped straight from the homework, so do the HW before discussion. Midterm and final are difficult, but practice exams should prepare you for them. Fat curve at the end of the class. 	7	3/28/2018
		Most people will have a harder time with this than 40A, so it's important to read the book and make sure you're keeping up with the material. It mainly focuses on waves, but there is some heat transfer involved. I had Igor Barsukov. His tests are pretty hard but the curves are huge, I got a 45% on the midterm, which curved to a B.	7	12/16/2018
		Tsai is unbelievably boring. The lectures are legitimately a waste of everyones time, too bad there are clicker questions for points. The lab is shitty, but easy. Online homework is on chegg. Pretty sure I got an A despite missing most lectures. Definitely a self-study class.	3	6/15/2019
		Professor Long was so nice but he expects a lot of outside reading and work especially if you wanna do well on the exams. Hardest class in the phys040 series	9	8/1/2020
		I had Pryadko, and it's very hard to follow lecture. The textbook was a lifesaver. I would rate this class higher (I ended up rating it a 6), but Pryadko's curve makes it so a 55% is a C-. Without that curve, this class would be a 9 at minimum.	6	10/8/2020
		Labs were quite time consuming as the manuals weren't very well written. Not too bad of a class though, just know how to use the formulas and you should be good	6	2/23/2021
		Do not take with Long. He makes the tests unnecessarily hard.	9	3/18/2021
		About the same difficulty as Phys40A. Took it with Tanedo Winter 2021. If able, take this with Tanedo, he will make your life and physics so much easier. 	7	3/19/2021
		Took PHYS040B with Tanedo. With Tanedo, this class was super easy. No quizzes, no tests, no midterm, no final. We have to make these weekly videos explaining how to do certain problems from the textbook every week and grade our peers on their videos. i think it's an effective learning format. Tanedo is genuinely such a nice guy and an amazing prof. Highly recommend taking 040B with him if you can. The labs are kinda painful imo, but they aren't too terrible.	3	3/21/2021
		try to take with Tanedo. he's the absolute best. no examinations, and he genuinely cares about how you are doing in the class and wants you to learn. grade based on you making explainer videos to show how to solve 2 physics problem given by him every week. made physics easy and entertaining, really is one of the best professors	5	3/25/2021
		Take this class with Phillip Tanedo if you can. It was literally a free class and the easiest A+ out of any class. About two videos a week and that's pretty much it. You'd have to try pretty hard not to get an A with Tanedo.	1	5/22/2021
		"currently week 5 for me and mills is horrible. just reads off pre written google doc, does irrelevant demonstrations and practice problems. for the midterm practice exam he didn't even want to give us the solutions. When we convinced him to give them he said ""here you go I dont even know if there right."" We have video proof of everything"	10	1/30/2022
		"(Taken w/ Comron Nouri) This course was the most unorganized class I've taken at UCR. The MasteringPhysics signup code wasn't posted until Wednesday of Week 2, and after it was posted, it got changed twice until it was finally the correct one. The syllabus originally had a 10% grading category for Poll Everywhere (clicker questions), but it got removed and the 10% was added to the midterms instead, which ended up making the midterms worth more than the final exam. Our TA said that the class average on the 2nd midterm was about a 55%, but Dr. Nouri never confirmed that the midterm grades would be curved or scaled. Personally, I scored well above the class average on that midterm, although it was in no part due to Dr. Nouri's instruction. I believe that I only did well because I put effort into the assignments, went to every discussion, and attended SI sessions. 

Also, starting from halfway into the quarter, I began attending Dr. Wei's (the other professor for PHYS040B) lectures instead, and as a result I understood the content much better. Compared to Dr. Nouri's slides, Dr. Wei's were much better at helping me learn the material, and my notes were much more detailed after switching. Most importantly, Dr. Wei's slides were adequately annotated, whereas Dr. Nouri wouldn't even provide solutions to the example problems in his slides. On multiple occasions, I was confused on an assignment, and after finding Dr. Nouri to be unhelpful, I got a better answer from a TA. 

Overall, I definitely wouldn't recommend Dr. Nouri for anyone planning to take PHYS040B, and I strongly urge the Physics department to reconsider having him in a teaching position."	7	3/13/2023
PHYS040C	7.07	Much more difficult than 40B.	8	3/28/2017
		About the same as 40B, but no practice exams provided means I didn't do as well on the midterms/finals.	10	4/1/2017
		"The class, itself, is really difficult and I struggled through it the entire quarter. Professor Sales, however, was a wonderful professor and explained the material thoroughly. I honestly recommend having her for your physics professor, even if it isn't for PHYS040C.
Side note, you really need to know the right hand rule for this class or you're going to suffer second half of the quarter."	9	6/15/2018
		Requires a bit of studying, but is ultimately not too difficult. Just pay attention in lecture and watch youtube videos to fill in gaps. Just don't take Monday labs as you will have to go over concepts that are taught in lecture later during the week.	6	6/16/2018
		Laura Sales was my professor. Very good teaching style, explains things well and does examples in class. Midterm is free response and multiple choice, while final was all multiple choice. I personally found 40C and 40B easier than 40A.	5	12/16/2018
		Took with Becker. I found this class a lot more difficult than 40A and 40B since I wasn't used to a lot of the concepts (I also fell behind so lol dont do that). The curves are gonna sharper since there was no helpful practice midterm or a practice final. But, if you score higher on your final than the midterm, the final replaces your midterm which is great!	6	6/18/2019
		Topics are tough so put in extra time to learn the concepts. Try understanding the concepts instead of memorizing as Becker tests more on understanding and applying. Much harder than 40B and 40A. 	9	5/14/2020
		Took it with Yanou Cui. It was her first time teaching it, so she did not offer any practice exams. I personally wouldn’t take it again with her as I don’t like how she explained things. It seemed like all she did was read off lecture slides from the textbook. Her exam questions were also mostly theoretical instead of working with solid numbers. 	8	6/12/2020
		Laura Sales was very easygoing during Fall 2020. She offered a modest amount of extra credit too. She really cares about the students learning, and overall, she was definitely one of my favorite professors at UCR so far. 4 exams total, each 5 multiple choice questions, and she drops the lowest score. If you're taking EE001A at the same time, you'll see a lot of nice overlap.	4	12/16/2020
		Professor Sales. SHE IS THE BEST PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT. Take this class if you are a non-physics major and would just like a class on physics taught in a casual, chill way. You will definitely learn from her class, and she is a great teacher. But she is also a practical person, and understands that not every one of her students wants to dedicate their entire lives around learning physics.	6	12/25/2020
		This class was made unnecessarily hard online, only 1 lecture a week (fall 2020),  a bunch of useless videos and a garbage textbook, if you have prior physics knowledge it is not that hard	6	1/2/2020
		dont do it with becker, he spends all of lecture rambling and not even half the class understands what hes saying. also he worries way more abt catching cheaters than making sure students understand material.	8	6/21/2021
		Took the class with Jonathan Richardson and the only reason I learned anything in this class is because of the TA. The homework and tests had no correlation. If you take it with Richardson, good luck.	9	12/14/2021
		"Prof George Becker - Spring 2022. The class itself was not easy, but if you pay attention during lecture, Becker explains everything pretty well. 
If you do better on the final, it replaces the weight for your midterm. Example, if the midterm was worth 25% and final 35%, and you do better on the final, then the final would be worth 60% and midterm 0%. Shouldn't be too bad, as long as you pay attention in lecture."	5	8/22/2022
		Taken with Michael Anderson Spring 2021 (ONLINE), who assigned MasteringPhysics as a form of HW. The exam questions were slightly harder than the HW, but it was manageable due to a lack of proctoring. The lectures were mandatory, as you will be assigned into random groups to complete problems and the professor would come to every group to ask if there are any questions and the problems/worksheet needs to be completed at the end of class.	6	4/10/2023
PHYS041A	5.00	This class is simply introductory kinematics; it's graded on a very nice curve where there is hw ,lab , a midterm, and a final. Professor Seto is an excellent teacher who will provide encouragement and insight; you can also get him to lighten up on grading if you beg him enough.	5	3/29/2017
PHYS041B	9.00	"The class covered about 18 chapters in 10 weeks, about 2 or 3 chapters a week. Homework was due everyother day sometimes 2 or 3 sets were due. Homework sets were set by leve i.e. CH14-1 (""easy"" homework) CH14-2 (harder homework). 2 labs a week, they were not bad, but required a lot of work. Quizzes were every Monday on the chapters we covered in the week. No midterm, the quiz scores determined you grade, if you fall below 40% You will get an email to either drop, change majors/class, or stay. The final was exactly like the homework question, but some where not. During class hours we worked on homework problems, he did not lecture, reverse classroom setting. TA were always helpful when asking for help and forgiving when it came to grading. Overall the instructor is great, but the class is insane."	8	3/27/2017
		Hw was  all online. This class is all self taught; professor Harry Tom rarely lectures. The quizzes and final are given without a formula sheet.	10	3/29/2017
		"The homework, quizzes, and labs alone are worth 50% of the grade, a passing grade (C-) is 40%, which means you can get a high C even if you get a 0 on the final. 

Not sure if it's because we have really nice TAs, the lab write-ups were cut off during the quarter, which means you don't have to write lab reports at all. 

Make sure to get to class every day from 9 am to 12 pm, the professor is literally doing the homework for you during class, and he does a really good job of walking you through - he doesn't get tired of your questions, in fact, he loves it. (The instructor was Professor Tom.)

For the quizzes, there is 10 quiz total, a quiz for each week except week one, and two of them at week 10. You will be asked 3 questions on your homework/lab, and as long as you get one right, you'll get a full score. He sometimes even goes over the questions before the quiz. 

This class is hard for two reasons: one, too much content within too short time. Two, it's really a jump from ""Oh I know all those, kind of associated with common knowledge"" (PHYS041A) to ""I actually gotta learn and participate in classes"". 

This is probably the class I had the most fun in, if not because I got really sick and had to skip two weeks of class, it would be an easy A+ (80%)"	9	4/6/2023
PHYS041C	8.00	"It's being taught by Anson (Dr. D'Aloisio) and Dr. Long.

 Anson's part was supposed to be easy. Daily reading quizzes are fair and homework and quizzes are fairly easy (and fair lol). The midterm will kill a great portion of the class. Since it was his first time teaching a lot of us were unprepared for the difficulty of the midterm, but aside from that the material itself is okay (you will need to sit and think about it though).

Quantum physics (2nd half) hurts. It makes no sense, and everything is counterintuitive. The textbook is exceedingly complicated and the homework problems are often never going to show on quizzes or the final (a few essential ones did but you will be able to tell what those are). By the way, Dr. Long's quizzes and final are based almost entirely on lecture notes (which he posts), but if you are cool with going to lecture, do so from time to time as sometimes some of the things he says reflects what you could see on a quiz.


The math gets so complicated you will need to use Mathematica. You literally only do that so you can get homework points smh. This class will force you to constantly ask the most fundamental of questions only for you to still be confused. Good luck!"	8	6/24/2018
PHYS111	9.00	Hamann isn't a straightforward professor- he'll assume you know some stuff about astronomy and will carry on through the lecture. His lectures are very poor: doesn't do example problems, assumes you know the astronomy stuff, and barely goes over the material in class (literally will just go through the surface of the material and wants you to read the textbook). He doesn't understand that many people in the class aren't concentrated in astro; they are other types of physics majors in the class.  He only has office hours an hour per week. His homework assignments aren't the easiest to do as well; you'll have to do some digging in the textbook. He doesn't do any example problems in class so that's where you'll struggle too. Midterm/final were difficult: he'll give you a study guide but each study guide had about 60 questions and each question required a 5 sentence answer. Too much to memorize/ understand	9	12/25/2019
PHYS130A	7.20	Phys130A is classical mechanics, conceptually the class is straight forward but mathematically it can pose a challenge. Like any other upper division physics course it is expected that you are proficient in mathematics. Dr. Beyermann was the professor when I took the course and he did a great job of building the conceptual foundation needed to tackle the HW from the Taylor book. His tests were mostly conceptual but also had some calculation problems thrown in. Make use of the textbook as IMO it is written fairly well. Also, your TA's should be an easy go to resource if you need it. 	7	8/23/2018
		will exams be difficult? how should I prepare before taking the class?	8	9/11/2019
		Prof. Gary is a very good professor. His lectures are really good, no need to read the book. Midterm is only on the first 4 chapters, final exam is on material covered after midterm. The curve is quite generous. Homework every week, but was easy to do. Understand the application of each formula and go over this lecture notes every week to pass his class.	7	12/25/2019
		Even with covid, Professor Gary was a homie and really made the class as fair as possible. He's a great professor and really knows his stuff. The curves are generous and you will succeed if you keep up. It becomes very very hard if you fall behind.	7	12/19/2020
		Took it with Dr. Bill Gary during the pandemic. Problems are much harder than expected on the exam but time was enough. The midterm was fair but not enough time. Homework is crucial. Work hard and it will pay off. 	7	1/5/2021
PHYS130B	6.00	Peng Wei is an excellent teacher. Teaches the topics very well! If you get all A's on homework assignments and at least an 80% on the midterm (midterm was homework problems), you're set for an A in the class. Final exam were 2/3 star problems so expect a difficult exam. Material in the class, in my opinion, were easier to comprehend. 	6	6/8/2020
PHYS132	7.00	Thermal physics isn't an easy topic, but Zandi teaches the topic alright. Homework are textbook problems, which you should understand. Midterm was basically homework problems/ lecture notes (very fair). Final identical to homework problems/ lecture noes (very fair). Ask her to give you a practice midterm/final and she'll provide you one. 	7	6/8/2020
PHYS135A	8.33	Aji is a caring professor, but teaches way too fast. Homework is doable, but can either be easy or hard. Midterm/ final weren't horrible, but also not simple. As long as you can understand the application of the formulas and the concepts, you'll be fine.	8	12/25/2019
		The concepts are abstract and math is insane. Luckily the textbook is really good	8	12/19/2020
PHYS135B	7.50	Barsukov is a great professor! He is very blunt and straight forward when it comes to teaching; no loopholes nor tricks. Simply teaches the material straight to you. Notes are at most 2 pages of big writing. Midterm and final are very fair. Homework takes more than 2 days to finish as they are pretty difficult. Overall hard class, fair class, great professor.	8	6/8/2020
PHYS156A	7.00	Yu is an alright professor, the material's difficulty isn't too bad. Book explained the material somewhat well, just wished Yu elaborated more on the topics. Sometimes, he had issues with his iPad, and made the material a bit confusing. He didn't do alot of examples, wish he did. 	7	12/22/2020
PHYS156B	8.00			
PHYS165	4.00			
PHYS177	1.00	Dr. Barton is a very good professor. Class is an easy A for physics electives. Just do your assignments. TA pretty much grades whether the code runs or not. TA and Dr. Barton pretty much set up the assignment for you as well. I didn't know how to code, but still got an A+ in the class. Easy A. 	1	6/8/2020
PLPA010	5.67	fall 2020: 3 small writing assignments & final. prof. ng is kind of funny	4	12/22/2020
		Took the class Fall 2021 with Professor Ng, the workload for this class is pretty light but everything is heavily graded and not doing well on one assignment/quiz can bring your grade down a lot. Taking the class as a GE is tempting since it has no discussion or lab as a biological science but be prepared to do well on each and every assignment to get a good grade.	7	12/10/2021
PLPA120	6.00	Mycology is easy show up pass the class	6	12/19/2017
POSC005W	5.29	I had Prof. William (Parkes) Riley. His lectures were an absolute drag and nobody went to them. He literally put paragraphs on the slides and then just read off them and uploaded them right after lecture so there was no point in attending. 3 papers, and the midterm was just two in class essays, the final was 3 take home or in class essays (your choice so I did all 3 take home). So basically, your whole grade is determined by a series of papers and your attendance, which made it quite easy if you're a strong writer. However, I would never take this class if I didn't have to. It was so boring and basic and I was bored within a week.	3	3/24/2019
		Took Prof. Riley Williams. We had to attend workshops (worth 7% of your grade!) for each of the essays we had to write (3 in total, not including the midterm and final). His lectures were boring, his powerpoints would just be huge paragraphs he'd read off of....which he'd later upload on iLearn. Only bothered to show up because he randomly takes attendance and you get points for that. Got an A in the class, but all the writing -and books to read- get really tedious...	6	3/24/2019
		Taken with Professor Laursen. Lectures without any sldies. Sorta boring - sometimes gets really intresting debates. Writing heavy - WAC Course though. Easy Midterm - 60% of Grade is based on essays with TA	6	11/4/2019
		Took it with Parkes Riley who is a very sweet old man. Lectures online were kinda hard to pay attention to. A LOT of reading. If poli sci isn't you're thing and you're a STEM major honestly wouldn't recommend ://	4	12/4/2020
		Took Online during pandemic with Riley Parkes. He's very knowledgably about the material, but his lectures are long and often boring. There was a lot of reading, but it is still interesting. Overall I would say the readings are the most important and sometimes the lectures are. There were 3 papers and a midterm. There was supposed to be a final, but it got dropped. 	6	12/28/2020
		Professor Kehlenbach is amazing. Lots of reading and writing, but not too bad. 	4	8/3/2021
		I found it difficult cuz I delayed the essays. But also the Mean score on the essays were always like 83-85	8	12/8/2021
POSC007	5.00	I had Professor Godrej, and grades were based only on a midterm, a final, and discussion. She is a fantastic lecturer and speaks very clearly. Her voice is gorgeous and she made the material easy to understand. The average on the midterm was a 78. She lets you make your own cheat sheet for it, too. I got a 99 on the midterm and the final was optional (thanks Corona) so I got an A+. 	3	3/28/2020
		i had prof godrej. theres a lott of notes you will take. tbh you dont need to buy the books cuz its hellaa $$, just make sure u go to the lectures bc her lectures r very dense and will help you the most for midterms/final. shes a rlly good lecturer and answers all the questions she gets, but sometimes she talks too fast and the info can be a lil difficult. i studied using the notes i took from her lectures and ended with an A. 	5	5/29/2020
		Took it with Professor Godrej. She really does have a beautiful voice. Lectures were online and not mandatory. I hated the midterm, as it was really difficult and my TA literally didn't do anything to help us. I've heard TA's in this class only give surface level in class activities and they don't really help. ASK questions if you need to during class ! Professor is really good with answering them as well. A lot of information about white philosophers, but she explains everything very well. 	4	2/23/2022
		Lecture's were so boring and there's only 1 quiz, 1 midterm, and 1 final that goes into your entire grade. If you mess up on one of those it is extremely hard to repair your grade	8	2/24/2022
POSC007W	6.50	Professor Mannies has been one of the most helpful and informative instructors I have had while at UCR. She demonstrates a vast range of knowledge across all of the topics discussed throughout the course. Professor Mannies was always there to support and accommodate for the needs of her students. Her evident passion shines through the interactions she has with her students. In every instance where I believed something was off, she helped me and did not have an attitude of annoyance while doing so. Great professor. ALSO: IF YOU HAVE ZACH DORSON AS A TA....BE PREPARED FOR HELL. 	6	6/4/2020
		Had prof. Wood. The class is pretty boring imo, it consisted of 4 essays (1st one is optional) based on the readings you talk about in class. Attend lectures bc he gives random pop quizzes. Make sure to pay attention to lecture and plan on taking pics of the slides bc he goes really fast to the point where its almost impossible to type it as he speaks and doesn't post them	7	12/10/2022
POSC010	3.67	Focus on the essays, they are worth the most. Overall super easy	2	1/10/2018
		Term paper graded pretty hard by the TAs but the exams were mixed MC/essay and graded very easily along with a curve. Easy A	2	3/28/2018
		Prof. Ritchie is so nice and easy. No Midterm just 2 papers, an online quiz, and a final. TA's are really chill	1	11/6/2018
		Prof Daniel Biggers online course doesn't require too much, except for mandatory discussions, a term paper, a midterm, and a non-cumulative final. Focus more on the term paper since it's worth as much as the midterm. Attending lecture will help you pass. 	3	7/1/2020
		DO NOT take with Bruce Bordner. It's a breadth course but he treats the class as if everyone is a polisci major. The midterm is worth 25%, the term paper has to be 8 pages long and is worth 25%, attendance in discussion is worth 20%, and the final is worth 30% but there's 13 pages in the final review that's packed with vocab you need to memorize! Just do yourself a favor and avoid him.	8	12/13/2019
		Took with Prof. Bishin. Chill dude, talks a lot about the Constitution (but not in a weird PragerU way). Follow the instructions and you'll at least pass. Do is a pretty nice and understanding TA	2	10/6/2021
		Professor Bishin is pretty chill with one synchronous lecture on zoom per week and the rest are lecture videos. 1 open-book quiz per week, 2 papers, no finals/midterms. The only things to keep in mind or pay attention to are his quizzes which can have specific questions and answers which can be very tricky to answer unless you double check with his readings and lectures where the answers can be found. Another thing is his reading materials which are kinda vague to read and half of the texts aren't that clear on what the readings are talking about. Overall, recommended for breadth courses but you just have to pay close attention and get some help from the TA which can help you succeed in his course. 	6	12/7/2021
		I took this class with Professor Benjamin Bishin and I hated it. He does not post the lectures online. His lectures are extremely redundant, goes over the same things for weeks. Does not really go through American Politics, all he does is go through democratic events currently and back in founding days. 1 explanatory paper and weekly quizzes. It is extremely reading heavy on awfully boring readings. 	6	12/27/2022
		professor dan biggers is a really good teacher. the class focuses on civil liberties, civil rights, voting and political representation, the branches of govt., and separation of power and federalism in the american government. 1 midterm, and a non-cumulative final. Also, one term paper thats 6-7 pages. 	3	4/5/2023
POSC015	3.67	Took with Prof Busacca.  Short answer essays on midterms and multiple papers.  No final, at least for my quarter.  Easy as long as you get a easy-ish TA grader and pay attention in class.	5	3/30/2017
		Had Gabe for Fall 2019, he was pretty funny and passionate and knowledgeable about the subject. There were a LOT of readings, like way too much and for one of the midterms, everyone basically bombed it but he curved it so most people passed. He won't be teaching winter 2020 so idk about the other teacher but this class pretty interesting if you like politics, if not, it is probably gonna be very boring for you. 	6	12/10/2019
		Easy A. I highly recommend you read the assigned reading. 2 midterms, one final. The tests  compose of multiple choice, fill in the blank and short answers. That may seem a lot, but if you go over the book and lecture slides, it's a breeze. I had Heba Hodaly. 	2	6/4/2020
		TAKE WITH IREPOGLU CARRERAS. So easy, just a bit boring but def an easy pass, and an easy A with minimal effort. Provides extra credit opportunities.	3	5/22/2021
		Irepoglu-Carreras is the best! If you can choose, take it with her. 	2	8/3/2021
		The first time you read a new topic it’s “I don’t understand anything.” The next read, you understand it slightly better, and the next  it’s interesting and you understand well. I’ve talked to other people in this classes discord and they all basically agreed. It is a pretty easy class that I would recommend if you want an easy class, with a little bit of a large reading(and a teacher that always sounds tired)	4	12/8/2021
POSC017	4.71	Lectures are pretty boring and the reading is overwhelming. However, the midterm and final are very straightforward and the content is not difficult. If you put in some effort and actually study, getting an A is easy. 	6	12/15/2018
		Professor Dionne taught this course - super easy, exams are given ahead of time and essay questions are drawn out of a hat. Your preparation matters for the exam. Thats really it	5	3/12/2020
		Honestly lecture is kind of interesting and my discussion was too especially if you have Ian. Not hard midterm was just an essay and some term definitions, final was two essays and two essays (fall quarter 2019)	4	5/13/2020
		Easy class as long as you put some work in and go to office hours. Professor Dionne is great!	5	5/14/2020
		This class is honestly so interesting and fun, it made me want to go into political science. I had Andrew and he kept lectures interesting & funny, really good at explaining things and I was rarely ever lost in the class. I don’t really think you need to do the readings, midterms and finals are accumulative so you can just read the textbook the week of to get more info, otherwise he explains it all in the lectures so no hw either, hw is up to the professor. For mine, we just had to ask a question on week 3,5,7,9 really easy but not in a bad way, made it a relaxing yet interesting class!! 	4	11/22/2020
		Took the class online with Freebourn for fall quarter 2021. Pretty easy class overall, that doesn't require too much effort. All my class had to do for homework were three surveys and we had to take at least two exams. There were a total of three exams (all of which were open note) in the class, but the third one was optional and could replace your lowest exam score. There are quite a few readings, but you can usually get away with simply skimming through them as Freebourn would usually talk about the material of the readings, during the lecture. As long as you pay attention during lecture and take good notes, the course shouldn't be too difficult.	4	12/7/2021
		online lectures were confusing but pretty interesting class. not the easiest class but if u try hard u can get a good grade	5	12/14/2021
POSC020	5.71	Irrepoglu-Carreras talks way too much; you don't need to write down everything she says. The 2 exams/final and notes are based on the slides/study guides. Reading the textbook helps to clarify the slides but you definitely don't need to do any more than skim the chapters. 	4	12/13/2017
		If you take this class with prof. Marissa Brookes, it's fairly easy as long as you just show up to lectures and discussion. there's 3 exams + the final exam so one bad grade won't kill you	6	3/14/2018
		Prof. D'Anieri knows his stuff. Prof. provides a study guide with the exam questions on it. There are usually 30 questions and 5 will be on the exam. TA's are really picky about the answers 	7	11/6/2018
		Had Brookes, her exams were hard since they were fill in the blanks and she wanted you to be very specific about things. 	8	6/15/2019
		I had Brookes, the class was awfully boring and the exams were hard since they were all fill in the blank. The TAs were strict on grading and wanted you to be overly specific.	8	11/2/2019
		I would stay clear of Professor D’anieri, it’s not that the material was difficult but the sheer amount of reading and relatively broad study guides made the class a big pain. 	9	12/10/2019
		Paul D’Anieri is extremely helpful in office hours, intelligent, kind, and has damn good music taste. DO THE READING. you have to know a lot of concepts and how to make a good argument. Overall a great and eye-opening class, just s lot of work 	8	12/14/2019
		Took it with Paul D’Anieri. He knows what he’s talking about, and is a great lecturer. His office hours help so much and he’s overall just a cool guy. Into music, always plays a song in the beginning of class. A lot of reading, but he wrote the textbook and it’s pretty good. As long as you know the concepts you should be okay. Two midterms and a final. Each midterm has five short answer questions and an essay for 50 minutes, which isn’t as bad as it sounds. The final has the same layout but with an extra essay and 25 more minutes. Loved the class!	7	12/20/2019
		no homework or papers, the test were difficult because of the time constraints (50 mins)	7	2/9/2020
		Took Irrepoglu-Carreras over Fall 2020 quarter, attendance wasn't required (even in her live session).  Ridiculously easy, her quizzes are graded by completion, not performance, you can just speed run through the quiz and still get 100%.  Her mid-term and final was open book and was not proctored, both were extremely easy.  The class only gets difficult if you have a TA that assigns quizzes on the readings every week, I got lucky and got a chill ass TA (she never assigned quizzes).  Shout out to Bea-Sim!	4	12/15/2020
		Professor Irrepoglu-Carreras made course very easy. Grading is based on bi-weekly quizzes that are participation based and 2 take-home exams. All course presentations and materials were easily available. Vocabulary heavy course, but easy to understand. 	4	12/28/2020
		I had professor irepoglu-carreras and she was really great! there's biweekly quizzes but they're only participation based and don't effect your grade. the midterm and final are take-home and aren't very hard at all, most of the answers you can find in her lectures. other than that, there's readings every week, but they're usually like no more than 12 pages and are pretty interesting!	3	1/11/2021
		Irepoglu-Carreras is the best professor! Take it with her if you have the choice! 	2	8/3/2021
		Had Prof. Brookes and her lectures were pretty long and boring. she goes over slides pretty fast and its a lot of information to take in. my notes from 1 week could be as long as 11 pages. she curves grades if the class average is lower than her expectation. i got a D on the first exam cus there were many fill in the blanks (w the curve i got a C), but for the second exam she made it much easier and the last question was a free one ;) posc does slightly touch on econ but its not a lot 	8	11/15/2022
		I took in person fall quarter with Marissa Brookes. Super interesting and funny lecturer. Readings not needed as long as you take notes in lecture because the slides are just an outline. As long as u go to all the lectures and take good notes ull get an A. TAs dont assign much, midterms and final are multiple choice and long answer and she is lenient about accomodation for test days.	4	3/8/2023
		i took this class fall 2022 and professor brookes is amazing! she was very lenient and has a good sense of humor. the class focused on international relations with some game theory and also monetary policy and transnational institutions towards the end. her slides are creative too	5	4/5/2023
POSC106S	1.00	Took it with Professor Leebaw and it was easy, the midterm and final were take home (no multiple choice, all short answer for both exams and an essay for just the midterm). Her study guides were like 15-24 questions and the exams had 10 questions from there. There was also one project which was a 7pg essay or a powerpoint presentation + 2 pg essay.	1	6/15/2022
POSC110	5.00	Took this class with Prof. Wilkes Riley and didn't find much info online on what the class is about. Focus on ancient democracy (mainly Greek aka Plato, Aristotle, etc). He is a really sweet professor and has a lot of knowledge on ancient and modern issues/topics but can really drag on and digress in his lectures. Lots of reading and your grade is basically based on only 9 essays throughout the quarter. Besides that overall the class is pretty easy	5	3/15/2023
POSC111	3.00	I took this class with Kurt Packzowski in summer 2022 and he’s the most laidback instructor I’ve had. Doesn’t require attendance because every thing he says in class is written on a doc which he gives all student access to. He gave us the option of doing either the midterm, final, or both. If you did both, they would count for 40% each but if you only did one it would count for 80% of your grade. Participation was also 20% of your grade. He also told the class that if you wanted more assignments to count towards your grade, you can just email him and ask. We studied the social contract theory and 7 of its theorists: Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Rawls, Mills, Pateman, and Fanon. The class was super interesting to me and whenever I attended class, people would have great discussions even if opinions differed. His midterm and final review are pretty self explanatory and quite literally tell you step by step how to write an essay that would get you an A. I only did the final and never participated hence why I got a B+ in the class, but I’m pretty sure if you participate and put a little more effort than I did, it would be an easy A class!	3	8/16/2022
POSC113	2.00	Professor Mannies was cool a lot of opportunities for extra credit	2	12/10/2019
POSC114S	7.00	Taken with Diogo Ferrari. Was a weird class since he teaches weirdly. Covers a lot of topics and ground. He was a bit frusturating at times since he would not answer questions directly, but the TA was amazing. Exams were similar to psets but asked for more analysis. Attendance was a factor	6	11/25/2020
		Taken with Ferrari. Hard course with a lot of theoretical concepts. He explains the concepts, but NEVER shows you how to actually apply them. If i did not have my TA, I would have failed. Midterm/Final are always curved because of how people perform. Most either do really well or fail	8	12/14/2020
POSC124S	8.00	Yasemin Irepoglu Carreras taught the class. Tests were very easy. Class had a Midterm, Final, 6-8 page term paper, class participation (random activities), and discussion. No textbook and weekly readings are not really required. Term/vocab heavy.	8	6/3/2019
POSC125	8.00	Jeremy Busacca taught the class. 80% of the class was based on 3 essays. Reading heavy. Teaching style is very freestyle. Id say many in the class are split between hating his style and loving it.	8	6/3/2019
POSC126	4.00	Taken with Professor Serieux-Lubin. The class was very easy and flexible. Two easy term papers and multiple-choice midterm and final. The only tedious thing was the discussion boards. 	4	11/10/2020
POSC126S	8.00	I took this course (online) with professor Grittersova. It was made up of 2 take-home examinations, an essay, and participation. We had a weekly live session and some asynchronous lectures. It was an interesting course, you learn about a economic models that progressively built on top of each other. It goes from learning about absolute/comparative advantage to contemporary strategies of economic development (and their rationale). The class requires a lot of books/readings, she provides some but you're expected to buy the rest. If you look hard enough, you can find the pdfs online, so I wouldn't recommend buying them. Overall, enriching course. The professor expects a lot from you (she is rigorous), but it's obvious she does this due to enrich our learning experience. I highly recommend the course. You must do the readings to pass the course (at least skim them).	8	12/11/2021
POSC128	3.00	Took it with professor Irepoglu-Carreras. It was a fascinating course, I'd say that half of the course is learning about political theory (e.g. theories of international relations) and the other half is applying them to contemporary issues (e.g. current environmental issues). The course was online: we had live sessions once a week and multiple short asynchronous lectures to watch. She provides all the readings (you don't have to buy any books). Grading was composed by 4 quizzes (1 each two weeks), a take-home midterm, and a take-home final exam (both exams had a multiple choice section and an essay) . All was open book. Overall, it was an excellent course, so I highly recommend it. Also, the professor is extremely organized (e.g. she color-codes questions), so you won't have any issues with not knowing what to expect. 	3	12/11/2021
POSC129	5.00	Taught by Gregory. Content was not too bad, but there is a lot of writing assignments associated with the course. 1 Midterm, 1 Final, 1 Book Eval, 1 Research Report. One opportunity for Extra Credit (worth 1.5% boost). Needs props because she was very responsive to student needs and adjusted deadlines if asked 	5	9/7/2020
POSC134S	7.00	Took with Professor Jana Grittersova as a business major elective. If you're okay with multiple weekly readings, then go for it (if taking it as an elective). As someone with bad study habits, this class was extremely tedious. It isn't necessarily hard material, it's just a lot. Skipping a lecture or not reading and waiting to catch up later is something that will bite you in the butt. Good and bad thing about the grading - it's only based on the midterm, a policy paper, participation (attending discussion) and the final. There was one extra credit opportunity which was just attending a seminar that counted for 10 points in participation. The midterm and final are the same format. Not sure if the same method of the midterm and final was done in previous years, but for Fall 2019, it was 4 ID questions and 1 essay question for the midterm and 2 for the final. She didn't tell us how many words she was going to put for the exams beforehand so we had to make sure we knew all the vocabulary (20+ words for midterm, then cumulative for final) and the essay questions (midterm ~8, final ~12). It seemed pretty overwhelming since other classes would usually tell you how many choices they're going to give you. She gave us 5 choices for IDs and made us write a paragraph of its definition and why the concept is important for 4 of them. If you tend to skip lecture, which I really don't recommend, you should always go to discussion. There's only one TA and he's super helpful. This was basically what made me pass the class. Honestly wouldn't recommend the class if you're a business major looking for electives to take, unless the reading and grading of it appeals to you (as in, no homework but the midterm and final will matter a lot more). 	7	12/14/2019
POSC137	2.00	Took it with Professor Leebaw and it was not a hard class just a lot of readings. The midterm and final were take home (no multiple choice, all short answer and an essay for just the midterm). Her study guides were like 15-24 questions and the exams was 10 questions from there. There was also one project which was a choice between a 7pg essay or a powerpoint presentation + 2 pg essay.	2	6/15/2022
POSC143S	4.50	Take all the classes you can with Weller. Super slow pace, can get by w/o reading, one midterm, one final group paper. Easy A imo	5	3/23/2019
		Course taught by Professor Merolla. Can get by without reading since most of the information is on her lecture slides. Need to purchase TopHat though. One group assignment about GOTV efforts. Not hard at all	4	5/29/2020
POSC144S	7.00	Taken with Professor Bishin. Super intresting lectures - hes a fun dude who really wants you to learn. Extra credit pop quizes. Take as many classes with him as possible. I learned more with Bishin than any other lower-div courses	4	11/4/2019
		Taken with Ben Bishin. It is so ridiculous how hard he and his TAs grade. I thought this class would be fun and interesting, but the harsh grading is ruining it. His weekly quizzes are based on the readings, but he words them so carefully that it's really difficult even to understand what he's asking. On our term paper, almost every student was given a C or lower grade. Paul Teten is the TA, and he grades unbelievably harshly for no reason. He told me my paper was good, but I got a C+ with no feedback. It is nearly impossible to earn an A in this class because of the grading. We are given the option to write a second paper, but the TA states that getting a grade over a B would be an anomaly. Ridiculous. 	10	6/1/2023
POSC146	6.00	Professor Merolla taught the class. Lots of assignmnets and group work. She is very helpful and approachable. 	6	3/12/2020
POSC148S	7.00	Took it with Benjamin Bishin. He is nice and understanding, but his lectures are dense and kind-of boring. He does not post slides and talks very fast, so it's hard to take notes. He assigns 7 quizzes in random weeks, so you never know what the topic will be. These quizzes are VERY hard. You need to not only complete the long and dense readings but understand the complex topics wholly because the questions are worded really difficult. I really liked how he assigned the term paper, though. He split it into 2 rough drafts that we turned in early in the quarter and used those and the feedback we received to complete the final paper. I ended with a B+ in the class. 	7	12/22/2022
POSC151	4.00	Took it with visiting professor Boniface Dulani. It was an interesting course, made up quizzes (1),Summaries of the readings (3), participation in the afrobarometer hackthon (a data-related event), a midterm, final exam, and participation. Since the professor was new to the school, there were some logistical problems, but other than that it was a fascinating course. Pretty much it is an overview of Africa (pre-colonial to contemporary times) from a political perspective. We covered governance systems, the impacts of colonialism, contemporary issues, among others. Highly recommend it! You can get a good grade by skimming the readings and going to lecture.	4	12/11/2021
POSC153	8.00	The class is very interesting, but readings are extensive and difficult. The only assignments are 2 essays and a research paper. D'Anieri is a great professor, but expects a lot and is a bit of a tough grader. Participation is heavily expected in lectures. I loved the class and got an A-, but if you're not dedicated to doing readings and are not a strong writer, you may struggle. 	8	3/24/2022
POSC154	2.00	Professor Irepoglu-Carreras is AMAZING. This class was very easy and was set up almost exactly like her lower div classes. 3 10-question quizzes, 1 midterm (mix of multiple choice questions that are mostly from prior quizzes and fact-based written questions), and a final set up exactly like the midterm. She posts all her slides and records lectures, and all quizzes and exams are open book. Nearly impossible to do bad in this class! She also randomly will do polls in class that can earn you extra credit if you do them! Best polisci professor ever :)	2	6/15/2022
POSC155S	3.00	Took it with Irepoglu-Carreras. She is the best. Her lectures are simple and she always posts them on Canvas. The class grade is entirely made up of 3 quizzes, 2 exams, and a discussion section. The quizzes are so easy (10 questions, open book). The midterm was written and in class, while the final was a take-home mixture of written and multiple choice. She doesn't assign many readings and there are no papers. She is one of the best professors in the POSC department! 	3	12/22/2022
POSC157S	7.00	25% first two exams, 30% final, 20% discussion section. I took this in-person with Pion-Berlin, and if it wasn't for my TA, most of the class would have done very poorly on the final. Prof reads off the slides, and the exam questions are worded very poorly, almost like they're meant to trick you. I spent hours upon hours studying for each exam, and couldn't get higher than a B. 	7	12/16/2021
POSC160S	7.00	Taken with Pererya-Johnston. Very straightfoward class with 2 exams and a paper. Only slighly annoying thing is that discussion section attendance was mandatory	4	5/27/2021
		Spring 23, asynchronous with Prof Noel Johnston. This was my second time taking this professor. I like this professor a lot as he is very kind and knowledgeable. The midterm is extremely difficult and I would not suggest having Eun-A as a TA and she does not help you. Eun-A also requires cameras to be on for discussion and she is not very nice at all. The one thing I liked about Prof Noel is that he curves grades so this helps with your overall class grade. 	10	5/29/2023
POSC161	3.00	Taken with Serieux-Lubin. Straightforward asynchronous class with somewhat long video lectures. TA was a bit of a mess and graded wildly, but besides that, the classroom components are easy.	4	3/18/2021
		Took this with Serieux-Lubin and was the easiest upper division polisci class I've ever taken. I took this online and it was asynchronous, I honestly forgot about it most of the time, and I managed to get a 98% in the class. She offers a TON of extra credit to the point where you can fail every test and still do well in the class with the EC. Take this if you want an easy A. 	2	12/16/2021
POSC163	5.50	Ethnic politics with professor Dionne. It was a fascinating course, I feel that you'll question and/or consolidate your identity after taking it. It's made up 9 quizzes(so one per week, based on the readings and class material), a 500-word essay (based on a transformative moment you experienced due to the material of the course), and participation in class. Overall, as long as you do the readings and participate in class it will be a breeze. Additionally, the professor is passionate about the material, so she will help you no matter what. Highly recommend it!	5	12/11/2021
		I took this with Dionne, she’s a sweetheart. This class was really eye-opening and such a great experience. The grading is 70% weekly quizzes (9 total, 2 dropped), 10% reflection paper (500 words), and 20% participation (self-assessed). The quizzes are based on about 80-150 pages of reading and about an hour worth of videos/podcasts, and are open note. As long as you pay attention in class, and do the readings, you're golden. 	6	12/16/2021
POSC165S	7.00	Taken with Professor Indridason. While the lectures move quickly, they're very interesting and honestly pretty fun. Professor Indridason is incredibly knowledgeable and very very helpful, as long as you do not hesitate to ask questions. His lectures are thorough and grading felt very fair, though that may be because I had a very understanding TA. Grades were based on papers, I think we did 2 or 3, and are fairly easy to write with clear prompts. Taking notes and paying attention is CRUCIAL to the course. 	7	11/3/2021
POSC166	7.00	Taken with Cioffi. Dude's exam was hard and his lectures are delivered in a boring fashion. He is SUPER smart though. He sorta drops hints about his exams when he talks so you should pay attention to EVERYTHING he says. 70% of grade is determined through Midterm Essay and Final	7	5/10/2020
POSC167	8.00	Taken with Cioffi. Super hard course with so much readings. He literally could bury you with his readings. They are also super boring and pretty dense, but that is conlaw itself. Hypotheticals are not as difficult as he makes them seem to be. Need to memorize so many cases and doctrines	8	5/10/2020
POSC168	4.00	Taught by Osorio. Course was very easy, but had a lot of daily assignments (e.g. daily quizzes and readings). Made memes and listened to podcasts. Not taught like how a traditonal law course, but learned some cool stuff. Participation makes or break the grade though	4	9/7/2020
POSC182	5.00	Taken with Noel Johnston. Simple asynchronous class with a lot of application of theoretical concepts. It can be tough, but the concepts themselves are broken down very well. Midterm's and Finals are very fair and require a lot of application. Some extra credit opportunities are available	5	3/18/2021
POSC182G	8.00	Taken Fall22 Online Asyncrounous with Prof Noel Johnston. This class is hard, but the professor doesn't make it hard. The concepts are a little difficult to understand. He uploads two small videos a week which are really helpful. there are no assignments for this class besides the three tests. The tests consist of 7-10 multiple choice/response questions. The tests are quite tricky but you can use your notes, videos, and TAs during the exam. 	8	11/21/2022
POSC198G	3.00	Do the readings and Loveridge will give you a good grade. Essentially, don't be exceptionally lazy.	3	8/23/2018
POSC201	9.00	Methods class taken with Weller. There are so mant readings, 4 short but concise papers that was really tough, and a lot of application of readings. You must read or you will fail this class. 	9	11/10/2021
POSC254	7.00	Taken with Professor Ritchie. Grad seminar that foucsed on a lot of readings and hard discussions. This course has a research design component that is pretty tough to do. Good professor who makes you feel very comfortable in class	7	11/10/2020
PSYC001	3.13	He gives you most of the answers to the test questions every lecture. So I got a B just by studying all the test questions he gave us. Never went to lecture.	1	7/1/2017
		Steve Clark is an amazing professor. I didnt even open the book for my two midterms and got an A and a B. Just go to his lectures, a lot of the quiz content is about his anecdotal examples. 10/10 would take again	3	3/27/2018
		Rosenbaum is a gem. Easy A. Gives you 20/25 exam questions ahead of time	1	2/6/2019
		Very easy for people who aren’t into psychology. Highly recommend taking it for a requirement. 	2	5/30/2019
		Huffman is amazing at explaining the material and really funny, definitely take it with her if possible. Everything is based on the notes, don't waste time buying the textbook. You'll definitely have to do some studying but most of it is easy 	4	6/11/2019
		Took it with Dr. Huffman. Good professor especially if you are desiring to take more PSYCH classes. Reading the textbook isn't super super important, so you can probably get away with not reading it because she mentions how theres only like two to three questions on the exam where the information comes from the book. Key to doing well in the class is memorization and understanding the notes she post on iLearn. Lecture is important to as she says things that rewards those students who attend lecture, but can get from a friend. Got a B+ and read the book and went to lecture, but beware of the Neuroscience part, required a lot of memorization but is doable. Note... on her power point there are presenter notes when you download them... OPEN THOSE and study those too.. questions from midterms and final were from there I vividly remember that. 	6	6/13/2019
		Had Dr. Huffman. There was 2 midterms and they were mostly from lecture slides and a few extra credit questions from the random things that she talks in lectures. You don't really need the textbook since the exams are mostly from lectures	2	6/15/2019
		Take this with Huffman. She's funny and actually made me want to come to lecture. Studying required a bit but you can pass without using the textbook at all. Write down some of the weird stuff she says in class, they come up on the test.	3	11/7/2019
		prof huffman: easy to get a B, hard to get an A 	6	12/15/2019
		If you took AP Psych in high school, it is basically a review of that. I never went to class or studied and got a B. I had Dr. Huffman, she's really kind. There's no homework but there are pretty much quizzes every discussion and 2 midterms and a final that make up your grade. Also, she drops the 2 lowest quiz scores	4	2/29/2020
		Took it with Professor Steven Clark. Always attend lectures because his exams focus more on what he discusses in class than the book. He posts his slides but they are extremely vague, so it won't be that helpful if you don't pay attention in class.	8	4/22/2020
		Easy A with Rosenbaum	1	8/10/2020
		took it in the summer with Dr. Huffman, intense 5 weeks. 9 quizzes (lowest one dropped), 1 midterm (average was 87% - 80 multiple choice questions, no backtracking), 1 final exam (80 multiple choice questions, non-cumulative), discussion attendance is mandatory for points, and some zaps & inquiztive assignments weekly. The whole course was on canvas, each week was posted in advance, no required live lecture meetings! 	4	8/28/2020
		Took it with Huffman. I think overall, it was decently easy. If you followed the textbook, read what you needed to, you could ace the exams. Recommend	4	9/30/2020
		Had this class online with Professor Ditta and would highly recommend. She is very passionate about what she teaches, and offers a bunch of extra credit. The assignments themselves are not very difficult. There are weekly assignments for discussion section, and lecture attendance is not mandatory. 	3	12/11/2020
		Professor Ditta is the best! She made the class flexible and very straightforward. There was 1 final, weekly assignments that are pretty easy, and extra credit quizzes. I'm really going to miss her class because she's just so kind and you can tell she enjoys teaching. Overall, an amazing class!!!	1	12/18/2020
		Took this class because everyone said it was easy but I almost failed. I took it with Professor Clark. He was very nice but I just couldn't stay engaged during lectures. His lectures also don't have words with bullet points so it's mostly just listening, which makes it hard for me. He is very approachable and willing to help so that is nice.	8	12/28/2020
		"Taken with Ditta in Fall 2020. Extremely chill online zoom lectures which I RECOMMEND TAKING NOTES ON (it'll help for the PSYC 001 study guide she releases a week or two before the final). I 100% RECOMMEND DITTA... EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND WANTS TO HELP YOU LEARN THE MATERIAL...LOVES TALKING WITH STUDENTS ABOUT VIDEO GAMES, OTHER TOPICS OUTSIDE OF CLASS AND IN OFFICE HOURS. She gives no midterm as well, only the final, and there are weekly assignments as well as a final project. On another note, she requires 4 hours of ""research participation"", which is done online. The research consists mostly of taking online quizzes that are used in UCR studies and each one is worth an hour, so do 4 quizzes on the UCR research site for easy completion. "	2	1/4/2021
		took online with professor ditta, she's great at teaching the material and gives you everything you need to succeed in the class. 1 midterm, 1 cumulative final & a final media project, all free response but it's open note/textbook. there are also lots of extra credit quiz opportunities!	3	3/29/2021
		Took this class Winter 2021 with Professor Ditta! AMAZINGGGG PROFESSOR I highly recommend her! She kept online lectures interesting and fun, & also provides a synchronous or asynchronous option for her students. The workload was not hard at all and the midterm and final was easy if you just watch the lectures. She is super organized so it made things so easy. Chapter in the textbook every week (although you don't really have to but the textbook is super interactive so it was very easy to read), Quizzes for every chapter (but you can just keep going till you get 100%, questions are unlimited), and then an assignment every week (but it was lowk busy work, only takes about 20 minutes). At the beginning of the week she also sends out what should be done for the week which is superrr helpful. Oh and media project at the end (I just did a tiktok and got a 102%, super easy) and UCR research hours (just participate in a study) Take this class!!! You'll enjoy it. Got an A+	3	4/18/2021
		Rosenbaum gives you all the answers in the lectures and in the reading. He is so adorable and sweet. He makes me laugh and makes it interesting. Make sure to go to every lecture and participate in every discussion if you want points. Hunter the discussion TA is really nice. Don't miss the midterm or the exam or you will have to write a paper.	5	5/18/2021
		"I took PSYC1 with Professor Ditta. She's really nice and tries hard to make the class engaging. It's pretty easy to get an A if you put in a little effort. Most of my friends and I ended with a 100%. The main assignments are a midterm, final, and a project. There are also discussion activities and weekly ""quizzes,"" that you can take until you get a 100%. 

This class is basically just about putting in effort and it's pretty interesting!"	3	6/2/2021
		Took with Rosenbaum. Easy A if you just put in a little work	2	3/27/2022
		Took the class with Annie Ditta and she slays. She is very nice and considerate. She hold her lectures in person but will have live zoom and records the lectures. Assignments are pretty easy the midterm/final are open note. 	2	12/2/2022
		Had Professor Ditta in-person. A great professor, very flexible and understanding. Easy A if you do all the work. All quizzes, tests, and finals were open-note and open-internet.  	2	12/9/2022
PSYC002	3.25	Easier than PSYCH001 imo	3	3/28/2017
		Its an ipen notes class	10	3/28/2017
		Extremely easy if taught by Prof. Sy. Barely went to lecture and passed with an A	3	3/14/2018
		Pretty easy, especially if you have  Dr. Rachel Wu. She does an amazing job breaking everything down. Don't really need the textbook because all of her tests/quizzes are based on the slides!	2	9/1/2018
		professor murray makes it fun and interesting, lots of EC opportunities in class but has clickers (20%) also in class, 4 exams each 20%	5	6/4/2019
		You are required to go to discussion like 25% of your grade depends on this...	4	12/16/2019
		Taken with Barton. Easiest of the series, most people will do better than they did in A and B. No curve, but tests are very fair.	5	12/17/2019
		Took with Rachel Wu. Really easy class. Quizzes can be taken twice, no midterm, final is online and open note. Assigned homework is minimal, just 3 simple newspaper article assignments throughout the quarter. Discussion section attendance part of grade. Go to lecture, read the textbook.	2	3/17/2020
		"Had it with Professor Davis Spring 2020 and she is so nice. My TA was also amazing - Pamela Sheffler. Only thing you need to do to ace the class is memorize the slides. 4 exams, the lowest one gets dropped so if you're satisfied with your grade you don't need to take the ""final"". "	2	6/12/2020
		I had Danielle Delany in summer session A for psych. She was super nice and easy-going. Her lectures were easy to understand. The tests were pretty much about the material covered in lecture. If you have her just make sure you know the lecture slides and you'll pass. 	3	7/29/2020
		"Took it with Prof SETO during online format and it was horrible to say the least. His exams required deep understanding of the material which he did not equip us for. I aced phys2A/B but I struggled with his teaching method in 2C. A lot of people would agree he could do MORE examples similar to what he would expect from us and just overall put more effort. I ended up with a B+ so its ""do-able"""	8	8/27/2020
		HELLA easy if you take this class with Professor Sy. Took this class during Fall 2020(online b/c of covid) and he only had 2 lectures live and made the rest of them asynchronous. Just keep up with watching the lectures(like 2 per week) and use the notes you take from them to fill out the study guides he sends out before the exams and you are guaranteed an A on the exams. Exams including the final were non-cumulative and open note + open textbook. Also, go to discussion because they take attendance and it counts towards your grade quite a bit.   	2	12/13/2020
		I had Prof. Wu for PSYC002 during online classes. All of the lectures, quizzes, and exams are asynchronous, so it's super helpful to go at your own pace. My advice to make sure you don't procrastinate because it WILL screw you over in the end. Make sure you watch the lecture videos and attend the discussion and you'll be fine. I finished with an A. 	6	3/8/2021
		I took PSYC2 with Professor Sy. Honestly, I would recommend if you just want an A. I feel that I didn't learn a ton, but the class was really easy. All the tests were multiple choice and open book. The professor is also super nice and upbeat. There wasn't much homework, just reading, which I guess was optional. The textbook is a little boring, but hey, it's free!	2	6/2/2021
		Took with Rachel Wu Winter 2021. Super easy class. Hardest part is just remembering to do it. Look up a psych article and write about it, sign up for studies, do the open note quizzes. That's it.	2	11/7/2021
		Professor Elizabeth Davis is awesome and her class is soooo easy. You have to buy the textbook to get access to InQuizitive, which is a downside, but the material is really interesting, and it's so easy. There are weekly quizzes on canvas, weekly inquizitives, and a weekly discussion assignment, which was a 500-word response based on the topics for the week. Her TAs are all super nice and very passionate. No exams either!!!! 	2	6/15/2022
		*Fall 2022 Online* Since it was online everything was open note so I don't know how it'll be in person. Professor Sy is a great professor and made lecture really fun!	1	6/18/2022
		Had with prof. Sy, just go over the slides, 90% of the test content is on there. The exams have a generous curve and its all multiple choice. Only a ~1k word essay at the end of the quarter is needed, but you get full credit if you even try a bit, can finish in 2 hours because the prompt is very easy. 	4	12/20/2022
PSYC011	5.40	Take with professor psy because he makes course easy	1	3/28/2017
		Took it with Coulombe. She talks really fast, but she makes the content pretty easy. If you took AP Stat, you're chill, but if you're not good with stat, you might need more practice. It's pretty straightforward except for the last two weeks (It's a little confusing, but still okay). Somewhat of an easy A if you pay attention tbh	5	3/4/2019
		Take with Dr. Annie Ditta if at all possible! She is overall extremely nice and understanding, and allows a cheatsheet (front and back of one paper) for exams. She also breaks down the concepts super simply and goes fairly slow/thorough to make sure everyone understands. Just understand the basic concepts/write down the differences between the types of tests for exams and you'll be fine.	5	3/16/2020
		Take with Prof. Natsuaki- makes sure you understand material and TA's pretty good	3	4/6/2020
		Took it with Duyen Trang. If you took AP stats in high school, then you'll be fine. If you didn't, Duyen does a great job at showing how to do it in a neat and easy way to understand. 2 midterms and 1 cumulative final - all open notes - that are open for several days for you to complete. About 3-4 homeworks are due before each midterm/final that are graded based on completion. Duyen also holds review section a day before each exam. Attend those because she goes over the study guide and it really helps.	4	7/1/2020
		Very math intensive. However, Natsuaki made this class pretty okay. I've never taken stats and I did fairly okay. Conceptually, it gets a little iffy at time and oh boy, the calculations are endless but not overall a super hard class. Lectures a bit boring but would recommend with Natsuaki overall. 	5	9/30/2020
		Took it with Natsuaki in Fall (Online). Honestly stats was really scary going into this but I came out loving the subject. The course is vigorous so carry your weight and you’ll do well. Also don’t be afraid to go to office hours for your TA since they do all your grading. We had 3 midterms and  a cumulative final. Also one paper and 2 weekly assignments. Like I said it’s vigorous but it’s not innately hard. Discussions were not mandatory except the last one to show a portfolio (another assignment). I would definitely invest in an iPad or a tablet so you can hand write upload your homework and test work easily. It saves a lot of time during exams. Exams were not proctored but make sure you show your work. 	5	12/28/2020
		Asynchronous with Natsuaki. Really good professor who understands that students may be anxious about this course and provides a lot of examples. TAs are also really helpful when it comes to reviewing material or hw. There's 3 midterms and a final but she drops the lowest midterm grade. There's 2 hw each week but they're not too bad. I'm not a math person but Natsuaki and my TA made this course not as bad as it seems	5	12/9/2021
PSYC012	5.08	Take over the summer so you don't have to complete 2+ research papers. 	8	3/27/2018
		Took it with Prof Franchak. The textbook comes with inquizitive so make sure to do those assignments for easy points. 3 midterms and 1 cumulative final. Study his slides and take the practice quizzes and you should do fine. Grade is split 50/50 between lecture and lab (aka research papers) papers are most important ask your TAs for help and don’t procrastinate those	6	6/21/2019
		I had Prof. Ditta and she was honestly one of my favorite professors I’ve had. She allows a 1-paged (front&back) cheat sheet on all exams and allows test corrections to get points back on midterms. She is genuinely super helpful and wants her students to succeed.	2	12/13/2019
		"Dr. Calanchini is a great professor and a very understanding person. He's great at applying concepts to relatable/funny real-life examples. Overall the material itself is easy, there's just kind of a lot of it. He does a ""midterm"" every 2 weeks (5 total, 20 questions each) which sounds awful but it makes the class way easier because you only have to memorize 2 weeks worth of material at a time rather than 5. They're usually pretty easy, and at least for Spring 2020 (online/during the pandemic), they were all open book/open notes. Usually there are 2 research proposals throughout the quarter but for Spring 2020 there was only 1. Either way, don't get behind on it! Also, DO THE INQUIZITIVES. They are basically practice for his ""midterms""/final."	6	5/15/2020
		Took this online during Spring 2020. Dr. Calanchini is an awesome instructor and also very nice/pretty lenient. The material itself isn't hard but there is a LOT of work, mainly because of the research proposal project.	8	6/3/2020
		Dr. Franchak was good professor. I enjoyed his lectures that would often have a bit of humor embedded within. There was a lot of content that was covered, but Dr. Franchak did a great job of organizing how the content was taught. I appreciated his willingness to be lenient on assignment due dates. He explained everything well and gave plenty of opportunities for students to improve their grades. Everything was on quizlet pretty much (Online Spring Quarter 2020 btw).	4	6/4/2020
		This class was actually pretty nice. For a 6 unit class during Spring of 2020, it was manageable. The Prof (Franchak) was SUPER understanding of the events that were happening at the time. Just off of how lenient he was and understanding of how people were dealing with things (1 paper instead of the usual 2, dropped lowest test, very communicative) during those times, I would recommend. 	6	9/30/2020
		Took with prof Franchak, he posts the lecture on Yuja. He is a great professor, there are 5 quizzes, final is a quiz as well. The quizzes are open note but you still need to know the material to answer the short answer questions. There is one 6 page research paper, but the discussion assignments help with it.	5	11/20/2020
		Calanchini - just do the inquisitives and take extra credit opportunities; materials are organized and it’s easy to reach out to the prof for help	3	12/2/2022
		Took with Professor Calanchini. Super kind and gives a good amount of extra credit opportunities.	4	1/25/2023
		took it with Megan Robbins. low rmp rating but she's actually rly good. no curveballs in her exams (some convoluted questions) but not terrible enough to where you'll get any lower than a B+ if you try hard enough. grade based on midterm, final and research proposal paper. procrastinated my paper to the last week but was able to get a 98% on it. just follow the rubric and you'll b okay! overall super easy and she's super kind and accommodating	4	5/14/2023
		Took with Dr. Megan Robbins. She explains things really well. Heavy emphasis on making sure no one plagiarizes. The discussion assignments are fairly easy and pretty straightforward. The midterm and final are tough so make sure you review, but you'll get a good grade if you study! Had one final research proposal paper (got 100%). Much of the discussion classes prepare you for the paper. During discussion, you will also learn to analyze data (applies concepts from PSYC011), as well as the use of excel. I recommend you go to TA office hours for help on the paper where they can make direct connections!	5	5/27/2023
PSYC013	10.00	PROFESSOR CURT BURGESS CANNOT FUCKING TEACH	10	10/8/2021
PSYC037	3.00	Best advice, create a google doc with the whole class and work on it for your midterm and final exam. Attend lecture if you can understand the topics easily, but if not, just take notes from the book. The final exam is 50% of your grade, but he does curve! Lecture and discussion aren't mandatory. 	3	12/18/2019
PSYC049	2.33	Psychology of Creativity: Professor Ditta is probably one of the best professors ever. She really prioritizes the learning and understanding of her students in terms of making her lectures very engaging by adding activities that help you understand the concepts. She has weekly quizzes that give you a sense of how she writes her exam questions which I find very useful. There are 2 midterms and 1 Final project (no final exam). 	5	11/5/2019
		Annie Ditta was the professor and she was a new professor to UCR. She makes the class so engaging and brings in interesting guest lecturers. Exams are extremely easy if you just simply memorize the content/ use common sense. There's a project at the end of the class, it's very simple practically everyone gets 100s. Just make sure to show up to every discussion. 	1	6/17/2020
		Prof. Brianna Mcgee was great and funny. Her lectures are actually interesting and the class is super easy, no midterm and the final is basically what you will be working on during the second half of the quarter.	1	2/15/2022
PSYC110	7.17	My professor was Dr. Abdulrazak. The class has a lot of information to remember, which made it difficult. Just read the lecture slides and textbook. There are 3 tests in total (“final” is not cumulative). Tests are fair, nothing too tricky. Average is usually ~76%. Also, there are 3 pop quizzes given in lecture so be sure to always attend class. 	7	12/16/2018
		Dr. Peter Hickmott is amazing and uploads all the slides. Tests are totally based on lecture slides and it isn't that big of a deal if you miss some classes (attendance isn't taken), but he explains concepts really well and it's easier to study if you attend lecture. It's kind of a lot of work because there is a lot of material to study, but most of the concepts themselves aren't very hard and the class is enjoyable overall.	6	3/16/2020
		I had Dr. Hickmott. Two midterms, one final, no homework. This is a very difficult class, but his passion for the material and teaching puts the course in a propitious perspective. Best advice is ALWAYS stay on top of the material, especially if you're a neuroscience major!!! The exams cover lecture/discussion material, so attend both. He doesn't try to trick you - everything is straight forward - but do pay attention to the greater details. 	9	3/22/2020
		Korzus’s exams were super hard for no reason. The exams were nothing like the study guide. 	8	6/21/2020
PSYC115	4.00	Quiz and essay/project heavy. Final is much harder than midterm. 	7	3/27/2018
		Kathleen Conner led the class as a TA. She was very easy. Half the class got a solid A. Midterm and final are literally based off the slides. Highly recommend for an easy A.	1	7/25/2021
		Took the class with Hickmott. This class was online and the midterm and final was open note. Don’t know how in-person would be, but he was very easygoing during online. 	4	3/18/2022
PSYC128	8.00	"Don't take this class with Daniel Ross. Even though he apparently was nice during previous quarters, he suddenly got pretty unaccommodating during Fall 2020 when I took this class. He also did things like give us a bunch of things due at one time during finals week when we were all stressed out. He also wasn't very considerate of COVID messing with our time/money. Unlike most other professors, those of us who had to get a job/extra jobs during school because of the pandemic weren't accommodated in terms of participation we had to miss (and it was 25% of final grade). He was also really inconsiderate about money, for example he said that a $50 2nd textbook cost couldn't be waived but it's ""just a fraction of your tuition anyway"" (he also mentioned during this announcement that people told him they were struggling to afford food/rent and he basically responded with ""That sucks but I can't do anything about it,"" it was unbelievable). The topics in the class were fairly interesting but Daniel completely ruined it for basically everyone in the class. "	8	1/19/2021
PSYC132	7.00	"Took the class with none other herself: Annie Ditta. As all the students know who's had her: she is the BEST. Super duper accommodating, super duper understanding, super duper organized, and clearly cares about her students and the courses she teaches.
However, this is a tough class. The concepts are interesting. BUT: you have a lot of assignments, and TA's were pretty tough graders. there are two exams (midterm and final), 10 extra credit quizzes, weekly discussion assignments (weeks 2-3, weeks 4-5, and weeks 8-9 were the three toughest ones, and weeks 8-9 was 20% of your grade). Lectures are not mandatory to attend, but lecture attendance does count towards your grade and she checks using PollEv. If you are unable to make it to lecture, you had the option to write at least 2 pages of handwritten notes to make up for it. 
Exams were pretty tricky, you cannot just memorize the concepts, you have to apply them as well. Both exams are 5 short answers. 
Overall, amazing and accommodating professor! But tricky concepts, and lots of assignments."	7	3/28/2022
PSYC133	4.00	Took it with Ditta. It's fun and she's a pretty lenient grader. 	4	3/13/2020
PSYC139	6.00	Burgess. He expects a lot of class participation. There's a 15 page paper at the end.	6	3/13/2020
PSYC140	2.50	Dr. Julia Revord is one of the nicest professors I've ever taken. She is super accommodating and taught the class really well. Lectures were asynchronous for the quarter I took it but honestly most of us only watched like 1 or 2 lectures and did fine, especially because it was all open-note/open book. No homework. Just some short multiple choice tests (20 questions) every so often, and the lowest one is dropped for your final grade. The topic is kind of interesting too. Highly recommend	2	1/19/2021
		Took this with Prof Hughes. Definitely take it with him if you can. He made the concepts easy to understand. Take notes and you’ll do well on the exams. Three 20 question midterms and a final and a short reflection paper. Best class 	3	3/19/2021
PSYC142	3.00	Prof. Sy is entertaining; he really makes an effort to be funny. Tests are easy and straightforward. The extra credit is crazy hard though.  	3	3/7/2019
		Psy’s a fun prof, I didn’t go to lecture much (3 hrs at night? no thanks) but attendance is required for discussion and the TAs give pop quizzes in discussion on the chapter for the week. easy A. 	3	4/11/2019
PSYC150	4.67	For the quarter I took Personality I had Dulce Wilkinson as the instructor, and while most of the course content was mostly easy, she was the most unaccommodating instructor I’ve ever had….. so many fuck ups from offensive test content & final exam content that was never covered to not wanting to give students access to CC’s on livestreams of lectures when they needed them for disabilities…… she seems like she’s an okay person but it was incredible how much she fought ANY change or criticism to the course up until it was time for iEvals…. this is her last quarter at UCR as a grad student but on the off chance she tries to teach here as a professor this info should be known before taking any of her classes!!!!	3	3/9/2022
		"A bit difficult, this professor didn't really present the lecture properly, as each of her lectures she would read off her slides like a poor TED talk. Then when it came to the exams, many of the questions would be worded weirdly, if they weren't questions that had been reused. Not to mention this professor would blatantly ignore students that would have questions about course content. One thing that really defines Professor Wilkinson is a very offensive question she put on the exam about personality disorders, asking the class ""which one is worse"". Now this question is subjective, but comes off as very offensive to those with personality disorders. She did apologize but made the excuse that other classes had no problem with this question. I do wish she was more professional with their work."	8	3/9/2022
		For the quarter I took Personality I had Dulce Wilkinson as the instructor, and while most of the course content was mostly easy, she was the most unaccommodating instructor I’ve ever had….. so many fuck ups from offensive test content & final exam content that was never covered to not wanting to give students access to CC’s on livestreams of lectures when they needed them for disabilities…… she seems like she’s an okay person but it was incredible how much she fought ANY change or criticism to the course up until it was time for iEvals…. this is her last quarter at UCR as a grad student but on the off chance she tries to teach here as a professor this info should be known before taking any of her classes!!!!	3	3/9/2022
PSYC152	6.50	Memorize the diagnostic criteria as soon as possible to make exams easier to handle. The final covers all 60+ disorders and there will be multiple case studies on it so don't forget them. 	8	3/27/2018
		"(Winter 2022) Updated review on Professor Natsuaki. There were 3 midterms in the class (3rd midterm is the ""final"" exam), but you 1 midterm score is dropped. Basically, you have a choice whether or not you want to take a midterm. If you do decide to take all three, the lowest score of whatever midterm you took is dropped. Midterms were pretty easy. First midterm I didn't study much and ended up with a C on it, but I studied more for the other 2 midterms by going over lecture notes and reading the textbook (but only to get more detail on lecture content), and I got an A on the 2nd midterm and a perfect score on the 3rd. We had to write a max 8 page paper on a book (very interesting book!), and another paper on a movie (an amazing movie). Lectures were mandatory to attend since she took attendance using PollEv (but there were time where she didn't do polls). Discussions were required to attend, but you basically go over class content.
Professor Natsuaki herself is a gem. Really sweet person, did her best (and did an amazing job) to accommodate this sudden transition to in-person. She knows that the topics she discusses in class are really sensitive, so she explained the concepts well.
Your TA's grade the two papers you do (movie and book). How tough the grading is depends on your TA. My TA was a pretty harsh grader. I put a lot of effort onto the two papers and got an 80% in the movie paper and 90% on the book paper. One of the other TA's though (Erick) I heard was great. He's supposedly funny, and a hella laid back grader. Also he's pretty close to Professor Natsuaki since he's TA'd for her I wanna say 5 times.
Overall: Do you have to put in the work? Yes. If you do- you're guaranteed an A (hence the 5/10 rating because it depends on you)."	5	3/28/2022
PSYC153	9.00	easily the hardest class I've taken, test wise. Professor words exams VERYYY intricately and throws in the most ridiculous small-detailed concepts into tricky exam questions. Be aware!!	9	6/18/2019
PSYC160	5.00	Took it with Pamela Sheffler and it was such an interesting class! You learn about the development of people throughout the lifespan, which is pretty straightforward and quite insightful. There was 1 midterm, 1 group presentation, a final project (paper), and a final exam. It may seem like a lot of work, but it really reinforced my learning. 	5	6/11/2021
PSYC168	3.00	Took this class with professor Murray, and while the class was obviously based on class/racial topics, she was extremely opinionated and most of the class was basically her ranting. She was also rude to students who asked questions and would often complain about them instead of answering them. Luckily the class was easy, just a few discussions with a final paper and lecture was mandatory, then a midterm and final that are both open note.	3	4/30/2022
PSYC175	4.00	It’s an upper division class, but honestly SOOOO INTERESTING. This class is taught my professor Clark and he’s very well versed in it since he created the class. I loved this class so much and he’s an amazing professor. I took the class online so it was a little different. But- 10 quizzes = 50% of your grade and 1 final = 50% of your grade. 	4	6/8/2020
PSYC178	2.00	"SPRING 2021 - Professor Melissa Wilson - Super interesting and easygoing class. The exams are basically just lecture material with a little bit of questions where you apply certain concepts to specific scenarios. 1 essay that is pretty easy because most TAs are really nice and helpful. 1 final, 4 ""mini-exams,"" and reading quizzes. "	2	6/17/2021
PSYC179	5.00	Dr. Robbins was fairly straightforward with her exams, but her intervention assignment was a bit difficult. You don't learn what's expected until after the rough draft is due. 	5	3/27/2018
PSYC182E	2.00	Prob depends heavily on who you take it with. i took it with Dr. Cecelia Cheung and basically the only “required” work was an in-class worksheet that we could work on together every week and a final project that was really minimal. No tests, no papers. As a psych major I can confidently say it’s by far the easiest psych class I’ve ever take, but this only holds for Dr. Cheung’s version of the class.	2	11/30/2021
PSYC189	7.00	Dr. Rosenbaum made the class easy but the material itself was complicated. Interesting class but you need to go to lecture if you want an A. 	7	3/27/2018
RLST001	4.00	Professor Alexander is not necessarily a bad professor. I mean, at the end, he did kind of deteriorate but overall his class wasn't all too bad. Make sure you get the general ideas in the books that you are required to read. Midterm and final exam are the same format and aren't really difficult. The one downside, and it's huge, is that the class was at the Theater and it was at 7:40 in the morning. 	4	1/1/2019
RLST002	3.00	avoid prof oh. hes super unprepared for lectures and has a somewhat heavy accent, reading helps with the pop quizzes but you can easily just google his study guides for the midterm and final, essays are pretty easy and weekly discussion posts are easy points 	4	4/21/2018
		took it with Dr. Isaac this quarter, at first I was reluctant but this was my easiest class this quarter. He gave us the midterm verbatim and plans to do the same with the final. Our only assignment was an essay in which it was basically just a writing exercise because he gave us questions to answer. Overall a great class and professor. 	2	11/26/2019
		Prof Issac will lecture forever but as long as you study the study guides you will pass the class easily. one midterm one final and an essay. don't need to go to lectures if you do the readings... overall not a very difficult class just make sure to do well on the exams.	3	2/7/2020
		if new teacher, professor Isaac moise from UCLA, easy class, 2 exams 25% each, final 6 page essay worth 20% rest is just participation/attendance, and the study guides were word for word the exam questions, show up to lecture, he would give us important information that only he would give to the 40 or so people who showed up to the entire lecture hall. difficulty 3/10	3	2/8/2020
RLST005	5.00	This class is overly difficult and complex when it doesn't need to be. Although there are only about 4 assignments, readings are dense and lectures are dense as well. Professor knows what she's talking about, but there is just WAY too much information to process at once especially when lectures are not recorded. 	5	6/3/2022
RLST006	2.00	Took it with Sagan. Definitely take Ali as your TA. One midterm, one final, one paper, and three quizzes in section. As long as you follow the slides, the exams are pretty easy. The TA was very helpful and made sure we were well prepared. Do not need much prior knowledge on Jesus or religion. 	1	2/21/2020
		I took this class with Professor Chang and I had Kori as a TA. They were both very nice and easy going. This class requires two books, one of them you can just find the pdf but I had to buy the other book. It was pretty much easy, just do your section's reading (the online class is set up in a specific way where you're broken up into groups and are given questions that correlate with your group number to which you answer during lectures). There was one midterm and one final, both of which Prof. Chang gave out study guides to (the guides were literally the exact same questions so make sure to do it, he also lets you use the guides during the exams). It's a pretty easy class, you don't really need to spend much energy and time on it. 	3	3/20/2021
RLST007	2.50	Professor Bayer is an awesome and chill professor. He knows that most of his students are only taking the class as a requirement and doesn't try to force the material on students. Course consists of three end-of-section exams and one final project.	2	6/2/2019
		Fall 2021. Eric Martin is a chill professor. He is always available for questions. Follow along the PowerPoint and attend every class. Attendance is mandatory. There are 3 free response quizzes and a midterm and an essay final. Easy class, just pay attention, don't slack like most of the people in this class. It is not as hard as people think.	3	11/22/2021
		I took this class with Professor Eric Martin. This was his first time teaching a class at UCR, so it took a while for him to get used to everything. While the class was a little disorganized, the content itself wasn't really hard. All the readings were optional, and the biggest grades were 2 papers and 3 quizzes. I got lazy halfway through the quarter and stopped attending lectures, but still managed to get an A in the class.  	4	12/15/2021
		I took it Fall 2022 with Dr. Paul Chang. There is some reading but not too much. There is no homework. An extra credit assignment was to go to the Career Center. The exams contain some vocabulary and definitions that the professor goes over in class and some essays. He gives out exam outlines prior. He is empathetic and really passionate and knowledgable about his field.  	1	3/9/2023
RLST012	1.25	Online, 2 written assignments a week(easy), 1 quiz a week. 1 research paper no midterms	1	3/24/2019
		Took with Alexander Michael, easy class. 4 books to read, 2 essays. Midterm and final was easy.	2	12/16/2019
		Took Alexander Michael, extremely easy class with a chill professor.  Lecture did not have mandatory attendance, but discussion section does (you won't have to worry about your grade if you actively participate in discussion).  Quizzes are given out weekly and contain 3-5 questions, it was multiple choice and you have three chances to get 100%.  I never read any of the books assigned and still maintained a 100% average on the quizzes (download the pdf and CTRL+F key words).  Our midterm and final were papers on the book you chose to read, prompt was easy and open-ended enough to read a few pages to get an A.  	1	3/7/2021
RLST012H	7.00	"Had Dr. Lucia... She's very condescending and makes you feel ashamed whenever she's like ""oh you guys should have learned this in high school right? my high schooler just learned this therefore you guys learned this in high school, too."" Anyway, the material can be tough to get your head around at times with someone like that teaching you...  Had weekly discussion questions, quizzes after movies we watched in class, take home midterm that took a while to finish, a final paper that was 6-8 pages long, and a final. Overall the grading is pretty easy but she makes it seem like you're going to fail the class and I disliked the professor which made me dislike the whole class in general. She could have made the subject much more interesting but she instead made it dry. "	5	3/31/2019
		For a breadth class, this was unnecessarily difficult. As an honors student this class was required W20 for first-years and it was insufferable. Even if the material was relatively easy, the workload was sometimes insurmountable in terms of reading and assignments - this is one of those classes where the professor acts like it's your only class and you don't have 2 or 3 others you're also doing readings and writing papers for. Dr. Lucia obviously knows what she's talking about and is esteemed in her field but sometimes acts as though we should already know half of the information she is presenting to us. She picks favorites and can be quite condescending. We also spent like 2 weeks on Native American religion but only 2 on Hinduism/Buddhism combined - of course there's only so much you can teach in 10 weeks but I felt that a lot of it was fairly disproportionate for a class about myth and ritual. Lecture was alright but discussion was based on Socratic seminar which I absolutely hated because attendance and participation (ie. speaking) were mandatory. If you have to take this class then just do as many of the readings as you can early so you don't shoot yourself in the foot later in the quarter before the final.	9	3/2/2020
RLST015	4.40	Took DEATH with Dr. Young Oh. No midterms, pop quizzes every week, & open notes final exam. Writing assignments every other week plus the additional writing assignments near week 8-9, one of them is about visiting a death site. A lot of reading so pop quizzes can make or break your grade. Discussion section is weighted similar to the final exam so make sure to attend. A lot of work but extremely interesting class. 	7	6/16/2019
		Dr Ana Bajzelj is definitely one of the best professors I've had at UCR. I took this class online in spring 2020 and she was extremely accommodating for all students during that time, as well as very accessible outside of class through email and office hours. There was a fair bit of reading (academic papers, mostly) but it was very interesting and related to the lectures, which were also very interesting. I took this class for an elective but I enjoyed engaging with the material, even if it was a bit overwhelming at times. However, the lectures are very comprehensive and sometimes a skim of the reading is all you need. 	4	7/21/2020
		"Took the class with Professor Cristina Rosetti and I loved it! It's called ""Death"" and it was a very interesting class. She made it an interesting class. Was very well organized, no midterm/final but there is a paper proposal and a 5 page paper and a quiz each week. The quiz is just written responses to questions she asks in lecture (2) and she lets you know when the quizzes are. It's more so opinion based and to see if you understood the topic. The ""final"" paper is fairly easy, just make sure you write on time and not the day before. "	9	1/15/2021
		Fall 2021. Thomas Calobrisi must be a new professor. He is pretty chill. J is the best TA. There are two small reading reflections (one pagers), one final, and attendance. Attendance isn't mandatory for lecture except for your discussion section. For the final you pick a book from a list an write about it, basically a book report. Pretty easy class, but weird topics. I feel like the textbooks didn't match with the class or course despeciation, we mainly talked about philosophy and death. Easy class.	1	11/22/2021
RLST044	5.00	Go to the lectures and actually listen to what Professor Chia is saying. If you do that the class will be easy to understand. Also, take notes; the tests are all based off of notes. Pretty easy overall. 	3	6/9/2018
		Professor Chias midterms are short answer questions and one picture ID but it’s hard to finish the exam in the 50 minutes given. Students complained but were brushed off. There are discussion questions, 2 midterms, and a final. I would take another rlst/hist if you want an easy breadth.	7	2/22/2021
RLST113	1.00	Attendance not really required, no exams during class. 2 short personal papers, 3 academic papers, 1 take home exam paper, 4 minute group presentation, and 1 group report paper. Professor Ali was great. 	1	6/15/2019
SOC001	5.44	Only take with professor simmons	3	3/28/2017
		Honestly if you put some effort in you should get an A pretty easily. Had San Juanita Garcia, tests were straightforward, but she's a bit unorganized. Just review slides or read the textbook and you'll be fine.	2	3/26/2019
		Really easy class. Garcia just kinda reads off her slides and goes really fast so be prepared for that. The textbook will be needed but only minimally; tests are based mostly on lecture notes and you'll get a study guide before each 	2	3/27/2019
		Simmers is an awesome professor. Tells great stories. Threw a haymaker on the second midterm, but there are a couple of extra credit opportunities for discussion and doing the bonus synthesis (only if you did the first 5 synthesis activities). Final was noncumulative	4	6/4/2019
		Took it with Professor Simmons. Don't underestimate Sociology. READ the textbook, as it is where most of the information for the course comes from. Easy C if you just review the google docs before the midterms, but if you want a B or an A, you need to read and actually know the concepts as her test were not definition based but were more conceptual in terms of applying your knowledge to real life examples and context.  I got a B, and I read every chapter and attended all the lectures. She is funny AF, so thats always a positive of attending lecture. Does not post lecture slides, but can get them if you make friends. Otherwise a good and insightful class to take, but reading is required for a good grade.	7	6/13/2019
		Jennifer Summers is great. Extra credit just from doing all 6 synthesis activities and going to discussion. Got an A on the first midterm and was able to slack off on the second midterm and final and still got an A. 	4	6/16/2019
		Took with San Garcia. Extremely nice and inspiring. Class is really easy and you don't need to buy the textbook since she uploads the lecture slides with the information you need for the exams. Make sure to do the packback on time since it's worth like 10% of your grade. Your TA can make or break your grade.	2	6/16/2019
		"The lecturer is amazing. I could listen to her read off a phone book, but the course requires 3 midterms based off of 100 pages of reading each. It's just more work than I wanted to put in for what was supposed to be my ""easy"" class. "	7	6/17/2019
		Schmitt’s both lecture & reading heavy for his course! Exams are lengthy & heavily worded so it’s quite neck breaking if you need to understand a question clearly. For an introductory class, it’s much more challenging & in depth than most. Study double the time & make your own charts to balance his lectures & readings! 	10	12/12/2019
		Don't take Christopher Schmitt!! He gave a 2 day midterm, one was written answers and then multiple choice. The final was 100 questions multiple choice, although he told us we might have a written just to mess with our minds a little more. :) His lectures are unorganized and not helpful at all (he writes a few words on the slides and talks about random life experiences he had which he tries to relate to the class) and he makes us read random chapters in the textbook instead of just in order. Typos and confusing questions were a regular occurrence in his midterm and final. Hard final and it was 45% of grade while midterm was 40%. Anyone saying it was easy or a good class is a liar. Coming from someone who got almost 100% on that hard midterm. 	9	12/16/2019
		The exams were difficult. They were mostly lecture based but the format of the the questions were overall hard. The readings were not all that hard and the professor gave a lot of exam hints.	7	12/17/2019
		the way professor schmitt taught was odd. there were no notes to write down. you had to catch everything he said as you never know what would really be on the quizzes and exams 	8	12/17/2019
		professor schmitt makes this class unnecessarily hard, but if you do take him get ready to study everything: lecture notes, textbook, and videos he shows in class. the final was really hard compared to the midterm.	6	12/18/2019
		I had Rotondi, it was extremely difficult for an intro class. the class itself isn't bad, it's just him. he's a great lecturer and funny guy. there are 2 midterms, a final and a paper (which is basically the easiest assignment we got). however, his tests are extremely tedious. he over complicates the questions, and it's mainly based on readings (which are extremely heavy). class is interesting, exams and readings are unnecessarily hard for an INTRO class. 	8	4/2/2020
		If u get prof. Rotondi, then drop it. He made the class way too hard. It is an intro class but didn't feel like an intro with him. He made the class way too hard. 	6	5/8/2020
		Took it online with Prof Janet Hill, class material in itself wasn't too hard. Midterm and final questions come from lectures, readings, and videos/films. Don't know if it was because it was online, but it felt like the class required a lot of work for a lower div. 	4	7/5/2020
		Not a difficult class but avoid Dr Hill if you get the chance. Was very vague about the midterm and yelled at me in front of a Zoom lecture of ~250 people when I tried to ask about it. Hard to reach by email and quite stubborn. Very unprofessional.	4	7/21/2020
		quizzes every week, rotondi pushed back paper and quizzes (pretty understanding), heavy reading and lots of recorded lectures 	5	11/24/2020
		Had Rotondi was extremely hard, 120 pages of reading a week, a quiz every week two different books plus about 2-3 hours of lecture videos a week sheesh.	10	12/5/2020
		I had Rotondi for Fall 2020 and he made it really difficult for an intro class. The weekly quizzes are insanely specific and are based on 100+ pages. Irrelevant details you don't think are going to be on the quiz, WILL BE ON THE QUIZ. I spent hours studying the readings and worked really hard to get an A, so DO NOT take this class if you have other classes to prioritize. He gave an extra credit quiz but that might have just been because of the circumstances of this quarter. The paper was easy because the TAs are pretty lenient. You can not slack in this class, I know many people that failed this course because of his quizzes so be aware. 	8	12/12/2020
		I had Rotondi for this class (Fall 2020). He’s a great professor. He’s very passionate about his teaching. READ! READ! READ! The class has quizzes and doesn’t have final.You’ll pass the quizzes as long as you read.	3	1/4/2021
		Spring 2021 no midterm, or final just weekly 20 point quizzes but they are easy if you do the reading. asynchronous only meet weekly for TA 	2	6/1/2021
		DO NOT GET SCHMIDT, THE GUY GOT COVID AND HAD THE MIDTERMS AND FINALS WORTH 84% OF YOUR TOTAL GRADE. HIS LECTURE SLIDES ARE HORRIBLE, HE DOESN'T CURVE THE EXAMS. LITERALLY YOUR GRADE IS THE TWO EXAMS PLUS DISCUSSION. THE MIDTERM IS TWO PARTS, MCQ AND 7 PAGES OF ESSAY QUESTIONS. I REPEAT DO NOT GET SCHMIDTT	10	3/1/2022
		took it will prof simmers, super easy, no midterm or final. 30 question quiz and short writing assignments every week 	1	2/15/2023
		Took with Rotondi winter 2023. Lectures and readings were very interesting, but so time consuming (40ish pages per lecture). 2 page paper based on 3 readings due every Monday and the midterm/final had hyper specific questions about content. The exams are open note, but if you don't have notes that reflect the readings and lecture verbatim, good luck. 	4	4/6/2023
SOC002	4.50	Takes attendance in lecture, assigns 10 page long paper but he gives a lot of time to do it.	4	11/29/2017
		My professor was Christopher Chase-Dunn, he tends to extend lecture time by 30 minutes so if you have class right after, leave when you can. Sometimes has important stuff at the end of the class time, so it's pick and choose. He passes out attendance sheet at the beginning of class and you can sign in at the end of it if late.	5	10/21/2018
SOC002F	2.00	Ignore the class, until midterm and final because they give you a very comprehensive study guide, which you can use to study well. The hardest part is the research paper, so invest a lot of time into it. 	3	12/6/2018
SOC002M	1.00	Intro to criminology professor Contreras very chill easy class basically soc through the eyes of minority crimes easy A 	1	5/26/2020
SOC002R	5.00	Aguirre is all recorded lectures, make sure to read articles too but overall not an abundance of material. Dropped lowest quiz score. 	5	2/17/2021
SOC003	7.50	"Very challenging course because there is a lotnof memeorization of theories and terms. However, it was insightful and interesting! I do only recommend this class to Soc majors or people interested in it. I know many people who failed the class...
"	8	3/23/2019
		I took this class with professor Rotondi, all I gotta say is run far far away especially if your major doesn't require this course to be taken. If you find yourself taking this class with him, expect weekly quizzes on the readings he provides. These readings will be long; don't take notes because they won't even matter. Converting the docs to a PDF and using command+f will be your best friend. Overall ended the class with an A because of that tip so I definitely recommend. 	7	12/24/2022
SOC004	5.75	Tests were all multiple choice based off lecture notes, not reading. Assignments are repetitive and more or less busy work and the last paper was basically a repeat of the first five assignments compiled together. I took it with Prof. Hill and she’s not the best lecturer. Be prepared to listen to her drone on and on about her personal life during class. 	5	12/15/2018
		Took it with Prof. Perry ( Amy Perry ). She made it an easy class if you attended the lectures, because thats what the 4 quizzes were based off of. If you attend the lectures, you don't have to read because she just talks about it instead. The lowest quiz is dropped.	3	12/19/2018
		Took this class with Schmitt, was pretty easy to follow cus it was online. Asynchronous lectures, 1 quiz, non cumulative midterm and final, both multiple choice, & 2 short response papers. The test questions were tricky and hard sometimes, but if u do the readings then it'll be a lot easier	5	2/2/2021
		If the professor is Amy Kroska, DO NOT TAKE THE CLASS. She's a terrible professor. 	10	2/23/2021
SOC005	9.00	I took this class with Kalousova and it was pretty hard. Go to discussions and put in work, doing homework cost like $120. Not an impossible class but definitely not an easy A	9	2/23/2021
SOC010	7.67	Took this class with Matthew Rotondi, do not take if you're not ready to read. Easily 40 pages per class and the tests are very specific on material. An interesting professor but not worth the workload.	8	2/18/2021
		Taken with Matthew Rotondi. I assumed this would be an easy A breadth course but he made the class so much more difficult than it needed to be. Very heavy on readings (you can command+F most of the articles since the exams are open note) and strict grading on the short answer portion of the tests. The plus side was that there were no discussions or homework assignments, just 3 exams total, and lectures were completely asynchronous.	7	3/28/2021
		Took this class with Rotondi and there is a LOT of coursework. Tons and tons of articles to read and the quizzes and exam questions are pretty specific to the articles. Some articles are extremely dense as well.	8	3/29/2021
SOC020	4.00	Grade is based on three exams and an 8 page paper, not cumulative. The paper is a research proposal. The study guide is basically the same as the questions on the test. Also, the answers are the same as the notes from the slides. 	4	2/21/2020
SOC030	1.00	Literally just exist and you'll pass	1	4/30/2022
SOC122	10.00	I took this class with Professor Rotondi and it was super difficult. I'm not sure who his TA was or how they graded papers. It seemed like he thought he was helping by changing deadlines. Remote learning was hard.	10	12/28/2020
		Horrible class; no TAs, Professor Chase-Dunn makes you read his own textbook + 4 other full textbooks, he grades all the assignments himself and the grades distributed are usually based on what he considers is correct; no rubric. Students were all extremely overworked and the curve still failed many of us. I spend 2 all-nighters in order to finish 40 assigned pages for this class and still failed. Ruined my love for sociology.	10	3/29/2021
SOC137	4.00	With Prof Kalousova, it's pretty easy. As with all of her classes, you're gonna need to do some math, but it's pretty basic stuff. Most/all of the info you need is in the lecture slides, which are posted online. I've taken every single one of Prof Kalousova's classes and I've enjoyed all of them so far. 	4	2/9/2021
SOC140	7.00	Jennifer Simmon is a good professor, straightforward about what she expects. The material isn’t too heavy, I didn’t study as hard so I got a B. Decent quizzes & exams aren’t crazy. 	7	2/17/2021
SOC167	8.00	Such a caring professor, clear criteria, optional zoom class because he records them all. A lot of readings & exams aren’t crazy unless you don’t read everything he mentions as well as watch lecture. Overall would take again but study! 	8	2/17/2021
SOC150	10.00	For all you CSBA majors out there, this class's exams are harder than CS exams highkey. Questions on the midterm/final are so confusing and have you second guessing. Too many readings to keep up with as well. The content is pretty interesting don't get me wrong, but my god Schmidt's grading scale was hot garbage. If you can take it with someone other than Christohper Schmidt PLEASE DO!	10	3/22/2022
SOC151	6.50	Some TAs graded the essays much harder than the others.	6	12/10/2019
SPN001	6.67	I had Senora Ballester and she’s a very nice professor. She’s very helpful but she teaches at a very fast pace and gives a lot of work. Classes are also mandatory and she makes you show your face on zoom. 	6	11/3/2020
		Professor Ballester is an AMAZING teacher! At first it seems like she is going really fast but her teaching style is great. I knew NO spanish and can actually understand it very well. Shes always open to giving feedback on homework and compositions so never hesitate to ask if you want that perfect score on your homework. Honestly  wish I could take her for spanish 2 because she ultimately wanted us to have a good understanding of spanish. Lots of class and homework though but pretty easy! 	5	11/30/2020
		"Yolanda Cardenas was my teacher, and I would highly recommend against her class. She felt rather unhelpful and spoke in Spanish most of the time, meaning I had no idea what she was saying, since you know this is Spanish one. For the final, 2 kids were bothering her about her not giving them attendance and told her supervisor, so what did she do? Not cancel the final exam like she ""wanted"" to and instead make us take it because otherwise those 2 students would have passed. Real nice."	9	12/7/2022
SPN002	6.60	Kind of tedious and annoying. Especially if you have Yolanda Cardenas. Good Professor, but it will require a lot of work from you with an exam one week and a composition the next. 	6	8/25/2019
		Winter 2021: Antonio Montoya. I’m a non native speaker with 4years of high school spanish (including AP Spanish). Overall the grading is harsh but he does try to make it easy for us to understand. He’s very helpful when it comes to addressing questions or homework. You have to actively participate during Zoom and turn on your camera. He takes attendance. The class consists of using McGraw broken down into 8 sections and everyday (Mon-Thur) the assignment deadline is due the next day before class starts instead of 11:59pm. There’s also chapter quizzes based on the homework and textbook. Two writing compositions during class time. Midterm is an individual oral presentation. I feel like this class was way easier than high school but I tend to forget everything so it was basically a review course but also relearning what I forgot. He wasn’t mean or rude like I hear about the other Spanish professors. The class was chill. Take him if you can! If you know more on speaking Spanish then this class would be easy for you. 	5	2/19/2021
		Taken during winter 2021. a lot of work and tedious especially if you aren't the best at Spanish. Lots of homework (every night plus studying). Grades somewhat hard for it only being Spanish 2. Attendance is also mandatory plus having your camera on	7	3/16/2021
		I took this class with Pedro Garcia Lopez and while he was nice, he was a tough grader and really expects you to get down Spanish. Class has 2 written exams, 5 textbook assignments and quizzes, 2 oral presentations (one for the midterm and one for the final), and a final written exam. However, the textbook assignments/quizzes are 30% of your grade, so do good on those and try to get B's on the other assignments. Be prepared because the quizzes can take a while to complete because of how lengthy the questions are. Plus the textbook was online and terrible (not to mention it was 50 bucks).	8	3/20/2021
		If you're taking with Oscar Valle, be ready to teach yourself all of the material. He teaches the class very differently than other TAs so he doesn't really seem like hes organized or has a lesson plan but he's pretty helpful. Spanish 2 concepts were okay, just lots of memorizing and I say if you're a decent spanish speaker and you're able to teach yourself, take him! 	7	6/1/2021
SPN003	6.00	It is not too bad, I say 8 just because of the work load. Lots of McGraw Hill homework plus extra assignments by the TA. 2 writing assignments and 2 oral exams just like every spanish class. It is important to know your grammar very well to pass.	8	6/2/2021
		Took Hybrid online and in person with Oscar Valle. Very understanding and good TA. He really makes it easy for someone that is struggling with spanish. Doesn't respond much to emails so try to ask all question in person if you can. About 6-7 quizzes that you can work on and go back to and pretty easy to understand assignments. 	4	11/12/2021
SPN004	5.33	If you are a Spanish speaker this is the easiest class basically GPA booster. If you are not a Spanish speaker this class will take a huge amount of time, make sure you practice a lot. If possible try to pair up or be friends with a Spanish speaker. Homework heavy!! professor navarro is honestly so sweet and he really does care, also super funny. 	1	6/3/2019
		Taken Winter 2021 (COVID-19 Remote Learning). Class is taught entirely by TA/Student Instructor. Heavy reliance on online textbook for homework, quizzes, and final. The online textbook is very specific about what kinds of answers it accepts, so be prepared to go into Office Hours often to fight to get points back. Pretty much daily homework assignments (30 minutes max), 2 short essays, 4 quizzes, two oral assessments (1 presentation, and 1 conversation), and then an online final in the same format as the quizzes/homework. Sounds like a lot, but it is spaced out nicely over the 10 weeks. For my class, cameras were required to be on, which made the class really enjoyable! Nice to interact with people. 	5	3/21/2021
		"Took with Professor Navarro. Lecture was 4 days out of the week with daily homework assignments due one hour before lecture. Workload is ridiculous for a lower division class, and is more in line with an upper division class. Homework mainly consists of particiation activities such as filling in the blanks, readings, and auditory exercises. This would be fine if there weren't up to 150 probelms due daily.  Even when doing all homework activities and taking thorough notes, expect to get a 70% on the exams, which there are 4 of during the quarter.
Professor Navarro is a strict professor during lecture, and grades harshly. Navarro also has a tendency to be rude to his own students, and inconsiderate of students' hardships despite going through his own.
Do not take this class with Navarro, and, if possible, waive the requirement for this class until Navarro changes his attitude or is replaced with another professor. If you are currently taking this class, I highly recommend leaving a harsh iEval at the end of the quarter."	10	11/13/2021
SPN109A	4.50	Hard grader. Professor Vargas very strict with native speakers, but prepares you well especially if desiring a major/minor in Spanish.	6	1/21/2019
		Took it Spring 2023 with Luz Landeros. Very nice professor; however, she is harsh on attendance and being on time. Many thought this class had a lot of workload, but I thought it was pretty explanatory and easy. 3 short essays and 2 in-class essays that are pretty reasonable topics. Easy grader, mostly grades on grammar/accents. There are Extra Credit opportunities & she gives you a midterm/final study guide which is EXACTLY like the exams.	3	6/6/2023
SPN109B	4.00	Class is hella easy compared to 109A. Taken with Mirta Copa Vargas and even though the class was hella on her head for being hard, she was not. Her essay topics can be confusing but asking others in the class is key to understanding what to write about. Once you understand her essay prompt/expectations her class is cake. I did essays two days before and walked out with an A. 	4	12/16/2020
STAT004	8.00	It was an 8am for me, and man boredom and 8am do not align. The discussions were ok, but  the class was incredibly boring, talking a lot about different variables wasn't my issue, but dedicating like the first half of the quarter to deciding which group each variable to go into was.	8	5/27/2022
STAT040	5.50	If you took AP Stats in high school then this class is way too easy. If not, it will require paying closer attention but still not super hard. Took it with Analisa Flores, she's really approachable and helpful. Everything is based on notes and they're easy to understand. No textbook. 	5	6/9/2018
		Make sure to understand how to use a bit of R programming. 	6	6/14/2021
STAT048	5.50	Took with Jill Smith. Never attended lecture, only discussions and labs. The labs honestly teach you with enough to get an idea of what's going on in the class. Easy midterms, but the final is cumulative and a little bit more challenging. Overall easy class.	4	12/17/2019
		Class was easy unless you weren't caught up with the material. The last couple of chapters were most challenging throughout the course in my opinion.	7	6/21/2021
STAT100A	4.25	Jill Smith is the easiest professor	3	3/26/2017
		Jill Smith is a great professor--the class is easy and the averages are usually in the upper 70's.  That being said, don't fall behind on class notes.  There's a few tricky topics.	4	4/2/2018
		Professor Analisa is great.	2	6/16/2019
		Jill Smith was lecturer, she can be pretty boring but she isn't horrible. The material itself isn't that horrible either but I think it got pretty weird in the end. She posts half written notes online and doesn't post annotated versions so make sure you go to lecture and copy whatever she writes down. 	6	12/15/2019
		Taken with Flores. Material is relatively easy, but be warned there is a discussion and lab, so be warned that it will require some work.	5	12/17/2019
		Took it with Joyce Fu while classes were online. She's extremely sweet and lenient, but not the best professor. I would recommend going to office hours regularly. Overall class was relatively easy, but the first few weeks' worth of material was definitely confusing because of her teaching style. Don't fall behind on the lectures because things start to pick up around weeks 3-4. The midterm, quizzes, and final were pretty ok. She let us have a cheat sheet for both the midterm and final, too. 	4	12/16/2020
		Spring 2021 - Professor James Flegal - Overall the class was very easygoing and pretty easy. Flegal is a very understanding professor and is open to answering question. Material was pretty easy if you put the effort into learning it. Expect to work with groups every week. Had quizzes called Performance Assessments, which were relatively easy. He provided us with practice performance assessments, midterms, and finals. Many of the practice exams were reflective of the actual exams, so make sure to understand them well. 	5	6/17/2021
STAT100B	5.29	Super easy. Easier than Dirty 30 and I never even took Stat100A. Professor Cappiello and the TA's are absolute studs. Textbook is also free as a PDF or $20 (new) on amazon.	1	12/19/2019
		Dr. Yingzhou Fu (aka Joyce) is to be avoided if at all possible. I only understood her lectures because I learned the topics right before I took the course, otherwise I would've been completely lost like everyone else. The OpenIntro textbook isn't super helpful, I'd recommend looking up YouTube videos to teach yourself. 	7	3/16/2020
		I took this class with during Yingzhou Fu's first quarter teaching, which make it unsurprising that I was quite lost for the whole quarter. Most people agreed that if not for the TA's in lab and discussion it would've been hard to actually learn. Since it was her first quarter, she made the class pretty easy to pass. 	8	4/2/2020
		I had Dr. Fu. She was organized but would go off tangent at times so it was hard to follow through with lectures. But the TA's were super helpful and clarified many topics. Midterms weren't too bad, so long as you did the homework. A lot of the questions were from the homework, just different values. Labs were pretty straightforward as well. Just put in a little work and you'll get that A! 	6	6/17/2020
		Take with Joyce Fu, she allows a sheet of notes on the midterm and final. No curve, but the average score was a B+. It is a lot of information to take in, so be prepared to practice a lot	7	12/19/2020
		the ta’s were really good however the course required a certain amount of self studying in order to truly grasp the material. Easy class to get an A but it was only so-so in preparation for other courses 	4	12/28/2020
STAT110	8.00	Took with professor Zhe Fei and wasn't the best experience. The professor himself is a nice person, however the way class was set up was he literally just read off slides and zoomed through them too. Lots of topics were covered in class and lots of them required outside resources to learn since I personally couldn't learn from how this class was structured. 	8	4/24/2023
		The professor himself was a nice and helpful person during office hours, however, the way the class was taught was not ideal for me. Lectures were him just zooming through slides, class examples hardly helped with hw, and overall class could've been much better if more time was taken to cover each topic with more examples similar to hw.	8	6/2/2023

STAT127	See BUS127			
STAT130	4.50	Taught  by Weixin Yao - Nice professor, but he doesn't really care about the material that much. Just take notes, study the notes, and it's an easy A. Office hour won't help because even he doesn't understand the stuff very well. It's formula plug and chug class. 	2	8/16/2017
		"Just RUN!(from subir ghosh)
The contents are ridiculously easy, but that doesn't mean an easy A at all because:
1. Prof Ghosh just makes everything difficult by always changing his idea.

Participation: Mandatory at first, halfway not mandatory, in the end included in the participation points of the final grade.

Grading scale: Refused to say anything about it until AFTER we got our grades by a lot of request emails from different students, and refused to show us the points we got for each section. Our grades were A/+- and B/+-, depending on whether you are in the upper tile or lower tile in the class. Like hell, does this even make sense? Why should other students play in my and your grade? We didn't even know this from the beginning. And some questions were not discussed in his lecture. Our final question points = final total points(no weight given), which means even if you gave a wrong answer in just one question then, bummer, see you in B/+-.

2. Prof Ghosh is extremely unorganized.

Lectures: Just writing down a bunch of formulas without proving/explanation. Use all the examples he made up, instead of real ones or at least from his textbooks. Contents were overtly easy. Usually spent half of the time going over last lecutre, and the last half sounded totally irrelavent to the first half because he never explained the connection between different parts of knowledge.

Textbooks: Enjoy reading children's """"encyclopedia"""" rather a real textbook.

No good grade-wise nor knowledge-wise. Genuinely disappointed."	2	12/23/2020
		Dr. Subir Ghosh is really nice but in Fall 2020 he was trying a different teaching style where he went SO slow and didn't cover very much material....he didn't really explain many of the topics well/in detail and was kind of disorganized. We all understood the material a lot better during the final project where groups of students were assigned topics we previously covered to review for all of us. It was just really unstructured and confusing, but I've heard he was a lot better before he tried this new style......but yeah, because of him teaching the way he did, I learned pretty much nothing.	6	1/19/2021
		Subir Ghosh for Fall 2021. Avoid him teaching this class at all cost. He is a very nice professor but that doesn't mean he knows how to teach well. His class is very disorganized, shows up to every discussion and doesn't even let the TA teach. We didn't know what to expect for each exams because he doesn't explain very well, just writes a bunch of formulas. His review sessions aren't even review session so don't bother. The homework doesn't align with his teachings sometimes and it makes it much more difficult to do - on top of that they mark off the tiniest of mistakes so you lose points easier. Ghosh doesn't like to use canvas so every assignment/ graded material was emails to us back and forth so it was very unorganized and hard to keep track of your grade. Content itself seemed easy but the class makes it 10x more difficult to comprehend. 	8	11/12/2021
STAT140	4.00	Taken With Professor Wei Vivian Li and she by far was one of the more considerate and accommodating professor that I have had. Midterms very much like the hw. The hw is similar to the slides shown in class. Main issue is the speed of the class. However as long as you do the hw you'll be fine. 	4	6/2/2023
STAT146	4.50	Time Series, for me it was taught by Xinping Cui - She had amazing notes available, and she taught the material well. Made sure the students understood what was going on. There's a final project instead of a final, but it's not bad. Pay attention and it's an easy A. Might wanna take 160A before this though. 	5	8/16/2017
		I had Weixin Yao for Fall 2021. Homework was given weekly and it was pretty easy as long as you refer back to the lecture slides.The midterm and final was all multiple choice and the questions themselves were pretty straightforward. He allows an 8.5x11 formula sheet front  and back as long as they have no examples problems/ hw problems. 	4	11/12/2021
STAT147	5.25	Taught by Linda Penas - Boring professor, she reads off of her presentations. The tests are easy, because they're mostly open book. 	3	8/16/2017
		Very organized and straightforward.	4	12/19/2017
		Strict grading but very straightforward class. Focus on labs and practice exams. 	4	1/12/2019
		The the practice exam is very similar to the actual midterm exam	3	2/13/2020
		Took this over the summer with Luke Klein. He taught this course pretty well and was also a great TA for another class. 2 tips: 1) This is a (guided) coding class more than a straight up stats class. Be prepared to rewrite/retry lines of code. 2) ALWAYS WATCH THE VIDEOS/READ THE TEXTBOOK/use the other main materials. It basically gives you the answers verbatim anyway so it's worth! 	6	7/27/2020
		I had Professor Analisa Flores and she is the sweetest. She clearly cares about her students mental state and is always willing to hear any concerns or questions in regards to the course. Thought the quarter, she was extremely helpful with homework and lab assignments, while quickly responding to emails. There is 1 midterm, 1 final where you must “study everything” but overall is not too bad. Homework, lab, notes, and practice exercises can be tedious, but is doable. Just don’t wait till the last minute to complete the work ! 	7	3/16/2021

		The class was basically a guided coding class. Each week we were assigned a set of lecture videos to watch and take notes on, a practice exercise, a lab, and a HW assignment. The lecture videos and notes took less than an hour each week and the practice exercise normally took about 30-45 minutes. The lab was slightly more difficult but we were given some skeleton code to follow along with. The HW assignments were incredibly long and honestly pretty difficult. Experience in R is not a pre-req for the class but it definitely helps. The course covers pretty basic concepts related to data cleaning and operations performed on data but it's a great foundation course for developing skills in R.	8	5/7/2021
STAT155	5.79	I had Zhiwei Zhang. Zhang allows us to bring one paper of our own notes to exams. He doesn't curve, but if you have good notes and understand the homework, you shouldn't be struggling that much. The actual content is very easy for the most part. I only seriously looked at the lecture notes the day before exams to make my notes and ended up doing well.	3	6/11/2018
		 Zhiwei Zhang. Lectures are pretty boring. The professor is pretty monotonous, not everybody can pay attention in those environment. Two midterms, one final. No quizzes in discussion, at least for spring 18. Homework is done on webassign, you can just google the problems if you don't understand. Just another statistics class needed to graduate. I don't understand but just do it it's required. You don't learn too much anyhow.	5	6/15/2018
		"Not that bad. Took it with Zhang. First midterm was super easy. Second midterm was quite difficult. The final was slightly easier than the second midterm. Homeworks were annoying but doable. 

My advice is get serious after the first midterm."	5	6/16/2018
		Professor Zhiwei Zhang. Hard to understand during lectures but is a really nice guy that will always be eager and thorough when answering your e-mails or when you attend his office hours. This class is extremely easy(like Algebra 2 easy) during the first third of it up to and including the first midterm. The content up to the second midterm and final will be noticeably harder(I'd say probably 3-4x as difficult). The key to doing well in this class is doing well on the homework and spending a lot of time on your formula sheet to ensure you have no blind spots in your understanding. The average on the first midterm was 16/20 and the second was 10/20 so you can kind of see what I mean.	7	6/19/2018
		I had Jill Smith. It's not as hard as it seems, it just requires a lot of time and energy outside of class that I did not really have. 	7	12/9/2018
		Had Prof. Smith, class ramps up in difficultly pretty quickly after the first midterm. Probably not the most challenging math course you will ever have but definitely not a walk in the park. Homework is through WebAssign, and is much harder than the exams in my opinion. If you can do the homework well without too much assistance you will do well in the class. Go to office hours and put in a decent amount of time studying for the class and you'll be fine. It also helps if your TA was as helpful as mine, Tyler. 	7	12/19/2018
		Didn't go to class after the midterm, but still got an A in the class. You'll be alright.	5	6/15/2019
		"CS Major's Opinion: Took this class with Jill and let me tell your this class will eat you alive if you're not into Math. 

First lets talk about the HW. It's Web Assign with three overall submission tries meaning each try counts for the entire assignment. The HW's are insanely long to do and all pretty much word problems so if you hated those well here they are to fuck you one last time before you graduate. The biggest helpful advice I can give you is to recognize what type of question each problem is asking you and to do each HW before the Quizzes.

The Quizzes themselves are the HW so if you do them before they are due you'll have a fighting chance. A lot of people didn't pick this up until too late. Every discussion ends with a quizz and yeah you get a quizz and HW literally a day before the final. Jill has no mercy.

All in all if you can get 90% and above on the HW's and Quizzes you may just pass this class but it won't be an easy task. THE HW IS HARD. This is a heavy class to balance and if you don't put time and effort into this class you'll definitely repeat it. "	10	12/17/2019
		The exams and homework were not hard. But the way the class is structured with Shuheng Zhou are what make it frustrating to take. There are no recordings for lectures. No chat during lectures. Which makes it hard to deal with especially for a 3 hour block once a week class. 	5	3/17/2021
		Probability and Combinatorics are the hardest part of this class. Sometimes differentiating between probability distributions can be tricky but if you keep up, this class will be easy. Make sure to do the HW as this is the most helpful part in ensuring a good grade on tests. Lectures are confusing so reading the book instead is useful. Teacher: Shuheng Zhou	6	3/25/2021
		Take it Professor Analisa Flores if you can, she's very organized and fair when it comes to grading and curves. Not a hard class, just hard to keep up with the content as it's a lot.	6	6/2/2021
		I had Analisa Flores. Wasn't too bad. Two midterms worth 15% each and a cumulative final worth 30%. Both were curved generously. Study the notes as much as possible and fill them out. Quizzes were worth 15% and are confusing at times, the correct answer choices often didn't make sense. All in all, great professor only thing I wish is that she could've provided us practice exams :(	6	6/21/2021
		Took with Analisa Flores Spring 2021. Dr. Flores is extremely organized. It feels like it's not possible to watch a lecture without learning something. She uploads her notes after class but never filled in, you have to watch the lecture to fill it out. Even still you should read the book, do the hw, go to discussion and stuff too because you can only get so far just taking notes in lecture.	7	11/7/2021
		Took it with Flores. She provides note outlines which are very useful. Tests/quizzes were open note so pretty easy. She’s nice and accommodating. Class teaches you useless stuff like high school math classes, so just think of it like that.	4	12/10/2021
		Material isn't too bad. Chapter 3 will appear kind of foreign at first, but once you get used to the rhythm of it, you should be fine for most of the content. Took with Flores. She's very fair and friendly.	5	12/10/2021
		Had Professor Flores for this class. Lectures are pretty clear and the testing is decently fair. The homeworks are pretty difficult and more difficult than any test questions so if you can do those, you're all set. There is calculus in the later materials. There are weekly quizzes that you have 2 attempts on which is nice. 	8	12/22/2021
		Had Flores I think, lecture was kinda hard to follow, but all lectures were posted online and she made note outlines for you. tests aren't too bad, as long as you know what formulas to use	6	3/31/2022
		As long as you show up and get your hw and quizes you be fine. The class is just videos which is fine I didn't watch all just the ones I couldn't logic through. There are a lot of easy points in this class you just have to remeber to get them done.	2	6/22/2022
STAT157	6.00	Taught by Linda Penas - significantl harder, because you're only learning SAS. And SAS is a horrible program. The materials are actually a little bit harder so pay attention in class, if you can stay awake. 	5	8/16/2017
		The course covered statistical computing with SAS. SAS is probably the easiest language you will learn as a STAT major. The assignments were kinda long but nothing was too difficult as long as you followed along with the lectures and the labs. The only hard parts of the course were the HW assignments which were very long but not super difficult. Copying and pasting from previous assignments is highly encouraged and essentially necessary if you forget anything. 	7	5/7/2021
STAT160A	7.86	Taught by Shemra Rizzo, it gets pretty hard if you don't pay attention. Homework was optional, but you better do it. Probably one of the hardest classes in stats major. 	8	8/16/2017
		Why were the tests so difficult ):	9	12/15/2018
		2nd midterm ramped up in difficulty and final was hard. Curve helped. Do as many hw problems as you can and you'll be fine. 	7	1/12/2019
		(During COVID era, with Li) homework was a super small part of our grade but you better do it. Quizzes during discussion really tanked my grade so be sure to study beforehand, I recommend having the homework done before discussion because the quiz was usually similar to a homework question or in-class example. Practice exams weren't super close to real exams however they help give an idea of what sections will be covered in the exam/how they will be weighted. 	8	12/26/2020
		Took the course with prof Daniel Jeske. The material itself wasn’t too bad. We had a weekly homework assignment that was collected and graded. No quizzes only 2 midterms and a final. Extra credit was offered after both midterms. Prof Jeske was really knowledgeable about the material, but at times I felt explained certain things at a higher level that made understanding things difficult. 	8	1/5/2023
		Took with Daniel Jeske. Really passionate about the subject taught at a good speed to follow, however some of the material he taught during lecture weren't explained the best. Was really generous when it came to grading. Midterms and finals were fair and not too bad. Recommend watching additional sources for this class.	7	2/3/2023
		Exam grades were so bad that the professor didnt even post the grades we got on the final exam. Curved the class without telling anyone when he was submitting grades bc theres no way i wouldve passed without that 	8	3/20/2023
STAT160B	8.25	Taught by Shemra Rizzo, it gets pretty hard if you don't pay attention. Homework was optional, but you better do it. Probably one of the hardest classes in stats major. 	8	8/16/2017
		Without a doubt one of the most difficult classes taken by stat majors. do not procrastinate hw and studying.	9	3/20/2023
		Took with Professor shuheng zhou. Her teaching style wasn't the best for me. Things often felt too high level. Was hard to follow the in class lectures most of my learning came from outside resources. 	8	4/24/2023
		Taken with prof Shuheng Zhou. Honestly not the greatest professor, goes over material super fast and struggles conveying things to the undergrad level. Additional outside resources for this class are helpful. 	8	6/2/2023
STAT160C	9.00	Taught by Flegal for me. He was a horrible teacher and the material was convoluted. Just like 160 A and B, there's at least a whole letter grade curve.	9	8/16/2017
		There was no curve for this class. You will question why you are majoring in this field. 	10	3/20/2023
		Taken with prof Shuheng Zhou. Goes over material fast. Lectures are hard to follow. Best read your textbook or go to the TA or professors office hours. 	8	6/2/2023
STAT169	8.00	Professor goes really quickly through material. Slides are really barebones that she provides. Use sources like your textbook or online sources. Get ready to write notes fast as she goes fast and doesn't give time to process during lecture.	8	6/2/2023
		Taken with Professor Kurum. Her slides aren't the most helpful and she tends to go by pretty fast in class. She didn't show almost at all how to do or think of doing these problems via R instead delegated that to the TA, but was unrealistic to expect one 50 minute session a week to be able to go over 2 lectures worth of material. 	8	6/2/2023
STAT170A	7.00	Taught by Esra Kurum - She's the best professor in the whole stats department. Won't make you memorize things, and her office hours are really helpful. She cares about her students a lot. 	5	8/16/2017
STAT170B	4.00	Taught by Jun Li - Not related to STAT 170A at all. She's a pretty boring professor, but the class isn't terribly hard. 	4	8/16/2017
STAT171	8.00	Taught by Esra Kurum - Significantly harder than 170A, but still doable. 	8	8/16/2017
STAT183	2.00	Taught by Karen Xu - Senior project class for stats majors. Joke of a class. The professor is teaching how to present, and she's a horrible presenter with stuttering. She doesn't really come prepared to the class. But the class is easy. 	2	8/16/2017
TFDP010	1.67	"I recommend Professor Bucklin for this class. He is funny, grades easily as long as you put in some effort for your acting, and practically gives you an ""A"" if you show up to the lecture (participation counts). There is no h.w. for this class. He occasionally gives small quizzes on the plays/screen writes (which can be found online) and write a short review for a play. The final is also super easy (it's a 3-5 min group performance, you get full points for participation)."	1	11/18/2019
		This class with Buklin was pretty easy. Only 1 midterm, 2 quizzes about easy plays, and no final. He's easy to understand.	2	11/22/2019
		Professor Carazo is so cool and the class is fun! 	2	8/3/2021
TFDP021	6.00	Prof. Floresislas is an amazing lady but unfortunately the syllabus was changed so much that we ended up completely throwing it away by week 5. Some of the assignments and work were done last minute and it felt very haphazard. Writing assignments are personal reflections on content covered in and outside of class and how they connect to course content. Be prepared as it is a theater class so you do have to act out some things, there is one midterm paper on a movie, and our final project was a one-act play that we write ourselves (although you can read off your script). Despite being confused with some assignments, mostly due to their last-minute nature I did learn a lot from the class, and the content covered was very interesting. 	6	12/14/2019
TFDP022	6.00	2 midterms with essay, the final is just a performance (monologue). Need to do readings. But overall the TA and professor are pretty nice. 	6	12/15/2020
TFDP050S	2.33	Annika Speer has fantastic lectures that are entertaining and engaging, absolutely do the readings, they’re not bad and genuinely helped for the midterm. Write your speeches about topics you care about!!	3	3/27/2018
		1. Start the reading early and the class should be straight forward. Professor Speer is extremely helpful and engaging in class. Participating in class is useful for feedback that helps with your skills in class. The class is graded mostly by the TA through the speeches, so follow the feedback given.	3	6/24/2018
		"Taken in Fall 2022 with Speer; This quarter was online so I don't know how it is in-person. My TA was really chill so it was a low-effort class where you can get creative. The assignments for ""lecture"" which was asynchronous were short (2-5 min) videos you had to answer questions to. "	1	3/13/2023
TFDP052	4.00	The class is no more than 25 students, class participation is key. Speeches are done in smaller crowds and feedback is given directly. The class toward the second half is great towards professional development and if taken seriously is useful. Examples of this included resume building, interview and cover letter for practice job interviews. Grading is slightly harder to get an compared to Public Speaking. 	4	8/24/2018
		Do the work and it’ll be a breeze. 	4	3/27/2019
TFDP066	1.50	Michael Bucklin. Easy screenwriting class, I think he said something like 70% of the class get A's so. Mostly effort based rather than actual content based. Lecture, discussion and screening. Screening is one movie per week. Some basic projects but not too much of a time commitment to them to be honest. I just make sure to show up (attendence) and turn in assignments and it'll be pretty difficult to not pass the class. Midterm from the textbook, short answer form. No final, just final project 5-7ish page outline of script.	2	12/15/2018
		"Honestly people should use this class if they're trying to clear out breadth requirements. This class can easily be taken with a full schedule, you'll have to put in 2 hours of ""work"" to watched assigned movies. On a bad week you'll spend 4 hours max. Just show up for attendance and do the work, it'll be impossible to get anything lower than a B."	1	5/22/2023
VNM001	5.00	Pretty easy class if you have basic understanding of viet or speak it at home. Heres the problem: theres only one professor so youll be stuck with her to level 3 or 4. Very strict on grading. Loves asking tests questions that contributes no help to the learning of language ex: unscramble this long 5 word phrase. ALOT of hw. My classmates helped me learn more than the instructor. AVOID unless Viet is the only foreign language you know.	5	9/8/2022
VNM002	7.00	Even if you already have good understanding of Vietnamese, this class can be difficult since we use vocabulary and phrases from the north, central, and south. You should know how to read and write before this level otherwise you will struggle. Cô Kim gives a lot of homework and is very stubborn. Attendance and participation is required.	7	2/26/2021
VNM003	8.00	"Vietnamese is taught by only ONE instructor, Co Kim. She is old, outdated, and unfair in many ways. If possible, AVOID taking Vietnamese if she is still the only instructor. She assigns long repetitive homework for every chapter, which is one a week. But it is worth very little points. Homework takes an average of 2+ hours depending on your skill in Vietnamese and typing in Vietnamese. 
Her knowledge in Vietnamese has been said to be outdated and inaccurate by students who are more intact of their culture from their parents. Even those parents are confused by her teachings. She yells at students during lecture (on Zoom), and accuses all of them of being unmindful if they are unable to remember 100% of her past teachings if they took her previous classes like VNM001 and VNM 002. She expects you to be above and beyond in Vietnamese, meanwhile her English is not on par. 
She accuses students of copying homework even though she encourages you to work together... and homework does not allow for many unique variations between ~25 students. 
She gives you a mock test at the beginning of the quarter to make sure everyone understands how her tests work... but then applies those points to your grade, therefore dropping it if you got a low score. 
She is biased and bullies students. She will round your grade up if she liked you that quarter, so mostly everyone tries to kiss her ass even though they all dislike her. 
She does not allow for absences or to attend class on Zoom unless you have COVID. She does not accept any excuse unless you have medical proof to show her, which is an invasion of privacy and heartless. She is ableist. 
I managed to pass with a B+ but I honestly do not understand how she calculates your grade. She does not know how to add weights her assignments in Canvas, so what you see at the end of the quarter may not align with what it actually is... Usually it is better by a letter grade."	8	6/22/2022
